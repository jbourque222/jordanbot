In fact 38% of Trump voters say they wish the South had won the Civil War to only 24% glad the North won and 38% who aren't sure. Overall just 36% of Republican primary voters in the state are glad the North emerged victorious to 30% for the South, but Trump's the only one whose supporters actually wish the South had won.
-By an 80/9 spread, Trump voters support his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. In fact 31% would support a ban on homosexuals entering the United States as well, something no more than 17% of anyone else's voters think is a good idea. There's also 62/23 support among Trump voters for creating a national database of Muslims and 40/36 support for shutting down all the mosques in the United States, something no one else's voters back. Only 44% of Trump voters think the practice of Islam should even be legal at all in the United States, to 33% who think it should be illegal. "

"""Consider the border tax adjustment, as it is being called, namely the corporate-tax-reform plan that also imposes some import taxes. I agree with Paul Krugman’s assessment that, for all its complications, this plan is essentially a value-added tax plus a wage subsidy (allowing corporations to expense in such a radical manner works out to a form of the latter, because the wage bill is written off from taxes.)

As a libertarian-leaning economist, I don’t favor either of those changes, or their combination, but still there is a logic here worth considering. Think of this policy as taxing the consumption of elites and throwing that money, and more, at job creation, in this case through corporate subsidies. It’s a bigger and bolder gamble than just making some marginal adjustments in current transfer payments."""

(Actually leaving Jan 11 but i tell people Jan 6th because I can’t pass up the joke)
(Actually no it’s been a bit of a dry spell since paramore girl)
(Actually not sure about that)
(All of course stemming from his dislike of the warriors, but like I said, people will come up with an excuse for anything)
(Also @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD id start Eli over Bortles this week anyway)
(Also at least we tried)
(Also congrats)
(Also I copied and pasted the full text onto MS Word. It's 38 pages.)
(Also I fuss he's president of basketball operations, not technically GM)
(Also I was against starting romo this week. I benched him in my other league for rapist jameis)
(Also smh bob stoops)
(Although actually he may not stick with them if they start sucking)

(Every meaning most of the time)
(Except the foreigners from Africa)
(Forgive me if I missed this convo before, never really looked until now)
(Going into the final weekend)
(Granted we are all majorly oversimplifying this. The 2055 funds are supposed to be more risky but also higher likelihood for steeper growth)
(hopefully)
(How was that?)
(I also bet Josh Allen at like +900 but let’s ignore that)
(I also got ambivalent right)

(I’m likely to have a third big yikes here)
(If it was haters of the poor I’d be right there with ya)
(I'm mostly playing devils advocate here but I saw a video this weekend that argues for eliminating the kickoff and it does make a lot of good arguments)
(I'm so sorry)
(Im voting for the AOC one)
(improper use of exponentially, my apologies)
(It may or may not have actually said that)
(It was supported tho)
(It’s for close range rocket defense, so they’d have to be launched from Mexico or Canada)
(It’s possible brooks is on the crushers, but I have an 11/12 chance he’s not)
(It’s possible I’m the weird one)
(It's 2 women)
(It's actually a sarcastic headline, and the article is very pro her, but it looks hilarious)
(It's also from family guy. And you're supposed to say "Hispanic, like from Spain?" And I go "Noooooooo")
(It's supposed to be what a model of your body proportional to nerve endings, iirc)
(Joe Paterno is kinda in his own category)
(Just trying to make Jeff feel better)
(Looking at you @B1G Buckeye Fan)
(Many have made that joke already)

(Probably not good long term tho)
(Prosti) Tutes
(Quarter flip)
(Quick sidebar: semi ironic that I’m probably one of the most liberal people at OTS)
(Ray Lewis is not there)
(sorry for complaining)
(Stolen) hot take that Pepsi knew this ad was god awful but also knew that it would get everybody talking about Pepsi
(Supposed to be a dig at Marcus)
(That’s what we call a curveball)
(That's how I pronounce cock like 70% of the time)
(The Chinese word for China is 中国, which translates to Middle Kingdom)
(This is an Edgar Allen Poe reference for the non intelligentsia)
(This is in now way related to me betting Broncos draft Fields +750)
(This is outside of Iraq/Syria and nothing to do with my operation, but I’ll still take credit)
(This post was sponsored by FriendZone)
(Though probably will want that in 15 mins)
(To John)
(Top 5 is too easy)
(Totally unfair btw goodwin is the least flaky person I’ve ever met when it comes to making plans)
(Unless education has a pseudonym for its official major)

@#FireAddazio  Reading more about this big 12 non-expansion. Apparently it's OU and TX calling all the shots, because they're really the only teams that matter. 
@#FireAddazio just watched SNL, it was good, Baldwin killed it hahaha. Love how half of it is literally just repeating Trumps actual sentences from the debate hahaha

@#JustFacts✅ I can ask Taylor patch (or someone else maybe) if he wants to play
@#JustFacts✅ I had the same thing happen. I just ignored it and turned off my old phone and haven’t turned it on since. 
@#JustFacts✅ I have read a decent amount about it. None of the big media have decided to pick it up, fwiw. I read she has quotes on the record saying her time under Biden was great, then in 2018 she said he touched her creepily at some point, and just now is saying he forced her up a wall and finger raped her. 
@#JustFacts✅ I never got any patented becker rant on me and Darrow’s trade

@#JustFacts✅ In case you were unaware there are currently mass protests in Cuba against the communist government. People are waving American flags and stuff. The government has started rolling in the military trucks (no tanks just yet) while also saying the protests are actually against the US embargo
@#JustFacts✅ is not just a pediatrician, he’s also a pathologist 
@#JustFacts✅ Is this who sent the phishing email 
@#JustFacts✅ It’s really fuckin close. Biden looks locked to win AZ, which would’ve been probably the end if he didn’t. Trump won FL, and is 80%+ to win NC and GA. If Biden wins PA it’s over and he wins. If he doesn’t, it’s gonna come down to the fucking wire with the individual districts in ME and NE. NV is probably Biden’s, but with the way the Latino vote has Beckered over to the right, it’s not a guarantee

@#JustFacts✅ Oh had a thought today about why the placebo group might still be anonymous. We don’t know how long the vaccine effectiveness lasts, and if/when another shot is necessary e.g. every year, etc. 
@#JustFacts✅ People are upset because the show took such a drastic turn from focusing on character development and interaction, to grand cinematic battles while putting dialogue on the back burner.
@#JustFacts✅ Regarding your earlier point, I think the tearing down statues of george washington, winston churchill, and Ulysses s Grant is where you lose people

@#JustFacts✅ Roast me baby
@#JustFacts✅ 's hero Nate Silver talked about this all the way back in 2015, about how the media and journalists have no idea how to operate with Trump because he is so totally different than what they're used to.  5 years later, they've still never figured it out

@Boe Jourque ??
@Boe Jourque As the resident socialist im surprised youre not more into death marches
@Boe Jourque Fair, but There’s nothing else to put stock into though. And that’s why I keep harping on the mass media’s role being sooooo important at this stage in the game, since name recognition is absolutely crucial
@Boe Jourque I don’t blame you, the stable genius president himself echoed that very sentiment for months
@Boe Jourque I wanna hear stories about Coleman
@Boe Jourque Idk it says poll took place over Jan 2020, article was in the Feb 2020 edition. But I don’t have any insight you don’t
@Boe Jourque If that turns out to the case, I wonder what the international fallout will be
@Boe Jourque My understanding is that KyBock is trading pretty much only options, so when the odds of his option working out plummet, the value of the option (not the underlying stock) goes to barely above zero.
@Boe Jourque No you have to put skin in the game because words are wind
@Boe Jourque progressive smart guy Noah Smith with a timely article on our defense expenditure debate a few weeks ago

@JoeBourque When we getting the QB Guru write up??
@Joey (Bruce Pearl BC Alum) Brackets the argument for who they “should” nominate and who will win is very different. I’ve talked ad nauseum about how if beating Don truly is the top priority, someone with crossover appeal (Biden/Mayor Pete/Beto/Klobuchar) is the best play, no brainer. But clearly the liberals, led by the sanders faction, believe in “my way or the highway”, which is a nightmare for the party. The value of the VP on the ticket is debatable, but personally I think it’s marginal. That’s not even considering that Bernie would need to agree to drop out and run as a VP, which clearly he’s not interested in doing. 
@Joey Brackets You’re forgetting a key difference, that Rudy Gobert is French. It’s in his blood to understand guillotines and reigns of terror, so I’m just trying to connect with him on a deep cultural level and apply the best intersectional solution

Totally simple and forgivable mistake, but Don quadrupled down and spent the last 5 days talking about the hurricane definitely going toward Alabama, including drawing with sharpie on an hurrican projection map so that Alabama was included

@John Thompson Finished the Obama article. Very very impressed, and it shows an insight that I rarely consider. The dude clearly is not stupid, but still, I disagree with most of his decisions even if his excuses hold weight. In fact this article only further demonstrates to me that Obama is rife with contradictions and he himself may not even be aware of them. It pisses me off how his closest advisors seem to not trust him. And I refuse to believe his politics and legacy are non-factors in his decision making.
@John Thompson Kasich is actually polling at an average of 15% in MA. For reference Rubio is at 18, Cruz is at 10, Trump is at 44... But since MA is winner take most, not winner take all, the trump dominance can be mitigated 
@John Thompson Ryan Braun. Got busted for steroids, then completely denied it and made a tear ridden speech about his character being questioned and his reputation smeared, blaming the tester for mishandling his samples. Got lots of people, including Aaron Rodgers, to believe him and publicly defend him. Then he tested positive again like 3 months later.

@Legitimate Business Man Do you think the Supreme Court should rule for Don to release his tax returns
@Legitimate Business Man I know nothing about the constitutional or legal aspect, but as the guy who wants all politicians balance sheets to be public while in office, I absolutely think we should see his tax returns. There’s also a precedent here with Jimmy Carter.

@Marcus Bauer 
@Marcus Bauer  I think COVID has shown how awful our current political leaders are in a time of crisis. Between the inability to pass relief bills without all the logrolling of partisan crap, to the poorly thought out restrictions, to politicians ignoring their own rules, to absolute buffoonery from the president
@Marcus Bauer  if RBG's spot opened up, would you be for or against filling the seat?

@Marcus Bauer as a lawyer, would you say the litigant’s documented statements of “nothing was ever officially agreed upon” and “I don’t care” constitute evidence against his own case?
@Marcus Bauer But you agree he should be impeached and convicted?
@Marcus Bauer Damn bro he didn’t have to come at you so hard
@Marcus Bauer Do we have a deal
@Marcus Bauer do you wanna do your long runs with me?
@Marcus Bauer have any hot takes you’re interested in wagering? Any over/unders?
@Marcus Bauer How bout Biden 4:1
@Marcus Bauer How much did you lose on the election?!
@Marcus Bauer I have a theory that the model is showing Biden odds at like 80% and they’re not comfortable releasing it with that
@Marcus Bauer I’d say this certainly helps my odds
@Marcus Bauer I’ll let you buy out now for $105
@Marcus Bauer I’ll offer you Bills over 9.5 at +1000 since I’m a nice guy
@Marcus Bauer If Kavanaugh saves Obamacare I will cry laughing 
@Marcus Bauer If Kyle Allen starts next week, I’d feel pretty good about our bet if I were you. Because I don’t see any way any team that wants to win sends him out there again
@Marcus Bauer I'm excited to see you my dude. Been a long time
@Marcus Bauer In a court of law, if you DUI and hit someone, is it worse than if you DUI and don’t? Legit question
@Marcus Bauer It's from a Pew study that's linked in the 538 article. It answers all of your questions
@Marcus Bauer Looks like another injury nullified bet. Kyle Allen’s foot just got ripped off his leg
@Marcus Bauer Lot of words there, but if voters were looking for a non-Bernie to coalesce around, they got one
@Marcus Bauer On one hand, sorry to Jameson. On the other, at least his hero behaves like his dad
@Marcus Bauer Run Saturday?
@Marcus Bauer Should get it
@Marcus Bauer So we have John and Goody, who I highly doubt, albeit for polar opposite reasons, then we’re out of former members
@Marcus Bauer Start with 1/3 Bernie 1/3 Biden 1/3 contested. Put your finger on the scale on where you put probabilities now
@Marcus Bauer Tell Jameson I’m all in on the bills 
@Marcus Bauer The model is out. Biden at 71%

@Skimmer tangent, but did your time in Haiti affect your thoughts on government and politics?
@Skimmer Tell us about Jenn Howard 
@Skimmer there are layers. They stopped allowing larges on a small bun, so you had to ask for one cheese instead of two, so when they came around to put buns on, they’d see the one cheese and assume it was a medium
@Skimmer There was also the stir fry options where you could get two types of protein, and they’d give you a half serving of each. But I would ask for one, then after they’d give me a full serving, id ask for the second

@The Big Dick Bandit I wholeheartedly disagree with that on GOT. Fans rated seasons 6 and 7 as very good, even though they basically sucked, because they expected there to be a resolution that made the nonsense make sense. Also, people still go back and watch shows like breaking bad and point out stuff they never saw before, and it’s certainly not to nitpick it.

@Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD  @Marcus Bauer  @#JustFacts✅  @Ryan Darrow  @Skimmer  You buttholes need to tell me when you are available to draft.  We have next weekend 8/29 and the following weekend 9/5. Considering keepers are due a week before draft day, we need to get this figured out
@Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD  In a standalone scenario, Econ101 says that the marginal value of every dollar matters more to the poor than the rich (which I personally dont 100% agree with, but I digress).  But the bigger thing is that it runs contrary to the core of Dem platform for the past 20+ years. Also with 2016 and 2020 seeing major shifts in lower income population toward republicans, it would not seem to be a good strategy to win them back.
@Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD @Ayatollah Thompson this is your moment. On your birthday and everything

@Two-Time didn't really think the article was too poignant. The main point is "everything Obama did is likely to be wiped out by trump." Meh. 
@Two-Time I didn't get the reference so I looked it up. Fucked up hahahaha
@Two-Time Not a bad article. I like his assumptions about terms, population, incoming economy, etc. but I don't like how he basically only compares inaugural quarter to last quarter, and nothing really in between. And I also don't know enough about the other presidents and their Econ policies to really comment on any of them

2) I disagree with that assessment on Iran since most evidence points to the contrary. The 1979 revolution was against liberalism and secularism action, in favor of islamism. Likewise, Turkey has shifted the same way in the past 20 years. The 2011 Arab spring all shifted toward ultra conservative Islam, and that was 8 years ago.  "

3 times maybe gratuitous. Twice for sure 
3 turnovers in ~2 minutes 
3) Are you not entertained by my takes?
"3) Top right was just stacked, featuring absolute juggernauts IKYW Trouble, 22, Tim McGraw, and Mine, as well as solid throwbacks in Fearless and Change. Mine vs. All Too Well was the best match of the Tourney, a clash of polar opposites, and unfortunately Mine's run ended early running into eventual champion. 
4) Bottom right featured Mean as the Cinderella story of the tourney. Bad Blood and Me were radio hits that just didn't perform when the competition got tough. Teardrops also scored a big upset over megahit Blank Space.
5) All Too Well is the best Taylor song and if you disagree, you deserve coronavirus."

538 has an article on /r/nba participation by fandom (flair) and it’s actually pretty interesting. The top comments per subscriber teams are: Pelicans, Raptors, Heat, Jazz. The lowest are GSW, Bulls, Rockets, Magic
538 has it at 18%. But their model is bad until the nominees are solidified. The more MAGA lunatics win, the more it creeps toward even. 
538 is comparing Jones here to Scott Brown, being a republican winning in Mass at about the same point Obama’s term
538 is that data analytics website I always link to. I'm asking lots of people because as n increases, the sample average approaches the true population average and standard error reduces 
"538 Live Blog just had a good summary of where we stand:
AZ: called for Biden by Fox and AP
NV: tight right now with Biden slightly ahead, but remaining votes likely to be heavily Biden
WI: Biden winning by less than 1%, possible recount 
GA: gonna be super close, waiting to count heavy D areas.  should know by EOD
MI: similar to NV, Biden leading by a hair right now with expected blue votes remaining
PA: lol give it a week
ME: called for Biden, but ME-2 is probably trump

A google engineer wrote a very long memo and sent it around the company. It was mainly about acknowledging that gender differences are real and affect work ability/personality, and criticized Googles efforts to eliminate any sort of that discussion. To different groups, it was either the definition of sexism and a prime example of the patriarchy, or a thoughtful discussion of a taboo subject that shouldn't be ignored because it's un-PC, or somewhere in between. The author was fired today, rightly or wrongly.

About 70% of HS students go to college at all. 65% of those go to 4 year colleges. So under 50% of HS students to go a 4 year college. So from a results perspective, any student who attends a 4 year college is “above average”. BC is at the top of that list of 4 year colleges. So, any and all BC students are at the very top of the success spectrum.

Accenture did that. You had to go in for a free test at a Quest Diagnostics and it would lower your premium based on how healthy the test says you are
Accenture does outsource stuff for cheap, mostly testing from India. But yeah that's basically what it is. Company needs a staff aug role or two for cheap, hires this firm. A hired consultant could move to full time at the company, or get hired by an Accenture. 
Accenture stock mostly lol
Accenture was also huge on pushing how impactful our projects were and I could not believe how effective it seemed to be on other junior analysts
Accentures best benefit is the employee share purchase plan. You get Accenture stock up to 15% off, if you commit for 6 months. There's a monthly % limit and a hard cap but it's still a great deal

According to the article, Sean McVay actually calls the audibles himself. The HC-QB mic cuts out when the play clock is at 15 seconds, so McVay has his offense line up super fast so he can read the defense and call the audible before that 15 seconds hits. Fucking genius.

Action Bronson's entire career is obscure sports references. He's right up your alley goody
Actual question, if a non medical professional did what he does, is it different? How about a physical therapist?
actual tldr
Actually
Actually a fascinating thought experiment
Actually a good question tho. To me it’s just “airer of sports”. For shows I guess ManningCast and Gameday? I guess people still use them for fantasy? Legit can’t think of anything else
Actually am very proud of this haha
Actually bump it to $20 each
Actually closer to $2000
Actually Darrow it was an immaculate conception
Actually Fred Van VLOLt
Actually fuck it I’m deciding to hate the rams 
Actually Goodwin you inspired me to do squats yesterday so that made today's class even harder haha
Actually Goody Rubio is far more conservative than he appears, for better or for worse. But Cruz and in some ways Trump make him look moderate (both politically and personality wise). Kasich and Bush are by far the most moderate of any of the candidates, but Bush is universally loathed and Kasich nobody cares about (though he is polling great in NH right now). 
Actually Goody that part is done by my PA, DeQuandrick
Actually has to be way steeper odds than this. Like Mike Evans never got an all pro he can’t be considered a failure 
Actually he doesn't fuck. He fails. If you opened the link you would know that. 
Actually he had a body double perform in Disney. He left for NJ that morning to spend the whole day with Anesto
Actually he's already been traded for Sam Bradford
Actually hysterical that Becker asked everybody if they want in for an air bnb then never followed up once that it wasn’t happening
Actually i do think she's pressing charges this time 
Actually I don’t even care about the secret part. Just make a list of 10 songs 
Actually I don’t think I’ve ever met a non south Asian Guyanese person
Actually i lied I’ve listened to a few of the kids see ghosts songs a few times
Actually I love all Nathan and Mimzy episodes
Actually I should blame Avicii mega fan @Gonzaga Basketball 2021 March Madness Champs 
Actually I think becker is the worst rat because marcus at least rats to help out his friend, whereas Becker’s rattage throws that very same friend under the bus
Actually I think I’ll get you legos
Actually I think my exact words were “is this really the best use of my time?”
Actually I’d easily take the over there. Over under 200?
Actually I’ll be Marcus. watching the clip, I don’t think you could make that throw 50% of the time 
Actually I’ll do $100
Actually I’ve never seen john either so slot him into #5 in my rankings
Actually I’ve probably seen Joe ski for a collective 10 minutes through his IG stories
Actually I'm betting above 250K
Actually insane how much the fucking fix is in for the chiefs 
Actually insane tho that Geno, Carr, and Dimes - all in that QB 15-20 range, are getting $35-40 MM/year guaranteed deals
Actually is ozempic cheating?
Actually it already is even if he doesn’t get fired 
Actually it wasn’t close to prime Barry bonds. Nothing ever is
Actually it would have to be reverse, sell price - keeper price
Actually Jeff I was sandbagging. Didn't wanna display my dominance too quickly 
Actually joes probably been railing Dartmouth freshman for months so we all owe him 
Actually John was statistically the weirdest in the lavatory habits world. He was a switch hitter with #1 and a crumpler with #2. Now he's tied with Goody and others. 
Actually just the slider
Actually let's up the stakes: full body massage from a gay man or open heart surgery from a Hispanic female doctor
Actually Lower burritos were by far the best
Actually made a lot of moves. Sold 3 relievers. Got scooter gennett and prospects so far
"Actually my master plan is slightly different:
1) Become an alcoholic, get diagnosed with alcoholism
2) Show up to work acting hammered drunk, but not actually drunk
3) Every day, videotape yourself with time stamps doing a breathalyzer and getting 0 BAC
4) Get fired for being drunk at work
5) Sue Accenture for workplace discrimination for my disease of alcoholism"
Actually my worst take is that Allen Robinson was gonna have a good year last year 
Actually no been a die hard Dino’s fan since birth
Actually not sarcastic believe it or not
Actually one of the biggest prick moves in sports. When lebron mocked the fans for being poor I hated him so much. This is worse
Actually People call me Big Jordan nowadays 
Actually Peyton Manning instead 
Actually several, but the shoulder is the one that happened today
Actually sign #7
Actually the only thing in favor of the Native American guy is that... he’s a Native American guy
Actually tho we are getting last no matter what
Actually tho. Absolutely shameless
Actually though I think elephants got a shot
Actually titans are close
Actually Trump’s statements on withdrawing from Syria have been discussed in official capacities, but no opinions, only assessments and plans
Actually unbelievable 
Actually we should strap him to a munitions pylon so he would be a cruise missile 
Actually what made me think of it was the episode where George buys Elaine a large salad for lunch, but his girlfriend hands her the bag, so Elaine thinks the girlfriend bought her lunch. George is furious and the whole episode is George trying to tell Elaine that it was he, not her, who paid for the lunch
Actually yeah. Was like 55 and not rainy
Actually, ability to control time 
Actually, after looking at my lineup, I still think minimum sell value should be equal to keeper cost. Let's take Aaron Rodgers: I could keep him for $55 or sell him for $50. That doesn't make sense to me
Actually, allow Sunday for MNF games
actually, i think the only times i've ever heard synergy used with meaning is in the air force. i.e. F-22s and F-35s operate in synergy with eachother
Actually, I'd even say that opposing torture is more of an extreme position than supporting it (meaning more people are pro than anti)
Actually... yeah you're totally right 
"Actually:
$100 vs Marcus on no contested convention
$100 vs Drachman on Biden over Don
$30:20 vs Becker on Don losing"
Ad
AD is a good pick. Boring but Lebron up there with his equally sorry supporting cast as on the Cavs
Ad Majorem Dei Ioseph
Ad overlays and all but it works for me
Adam Dunn
Adam SLOLver. Or Lebron could’ve just gotten the damn vaccine
Adam ThieLOLn
Adams is better and cheaper 
Adams is def top 3. I agree taylor is 6-10. But Marcus mentioned he is currently RB16 and implied that’s where he belongs
Add it to the BRD John
Add me on snapchat
Add the Philippines to that list
ADDAZIO APPEARANCE
Addazio is gone. You don’t have to root against BC anymore
Addazio is Joe’s Donald trump 
Addendum to this
Addies was so overrated
Adding one country this summer
Additionally hilarious is that they signed Mozgov for that much and that long in literally the first few hours of free agency, as if they needed to snatch him up quick 
Additionally shoo in picks in the NFL are rare, so it's hard to not pick one when it presents itself
Additionally, come November, I bet Donny T is going to wish he never ran for president
Additionally, in order to guarantee transparency and make sure this doesn't happen, DF will have to publish their players' entry data so everybody can do what these guys were doing. Therefore early entries will be at a huge disadvantage to late ones 
Additionally, Jones tested for 17 supplements. He only listed 10 on his official declaration to USADA. He also admitted that he’s never once taken the USADA mandatory training and that his management did it for him and forged his signature for the past few years
Additionally, there was a pew study about Latino views of their own identity. 47% use country of heritage, 39% use Hispanic/latino, and 14% use American. However both country of heritage and Latino shrink significantly between first-second-third generation
Additionally, this referendum isn't official. If the result is majority want to leave, the government is NOT officially obliged to do so
Adirondacks?
Adjusting is easy. Setting the line is hard. They goofed really bad with pacquiao mayweather at the beginning
Admittedly could be wrong here
Admittedly not my best nickname
Admittedly, the larger the welfare state, the more it politically helps the Left. Especially when the country is telling them they are victims and scapegoat the others.
Adrian Peterson did nothing wrong 
AEI, National Review, Reason, Red State, RealClearPolitics. Those are all pretty good
AF = Air Force 
AF Reg require the stache to be no wider than corners of the mouth, so it’s a little hitlery
afaik there’s only one fight that really matters 
"AFAIK:
Bojo resigned
Truss was an out of the blue selection by the tories 
She was a disaster, highlighted by the mini budget thing above which crushed their bonds
The labor party are still insane"
AFC East has a legit claim. Especially if jets bounce back to near 500.  West might be second best because no cakewalks, and a step up from south. North was a dumpster fire this year and I don’t think having Big Ben back changes it all
AFC Power Rankings. Who makes up the top 5?
AFC west has 2 terrible teams tho
AFC West on paper best division of all time
Afebrile.  I’m gonna use that in my next doctors appointment 
Afghanistan 
Afghanistan is such a shitshow and it’s making my life stressful
AFN is effectively cable
Africa is Egypt?

After it has my blood and brains all over it? You nasty
After last season Ners we’re allegedly looking for 2 2nds (lol) so depends what they’re willing to accept
After making everybody Plan around him and committing to a date
After Mookie Betts, idk how any Boston fan would wanna trade anybody every again
After reading this and watch the Yale video that Jeff posted, I don't know how anybody can objectively side with these types of protestors.
After seeing goodys post
After some discussion, I’m gonna go super chalk. Many of these guys appear to be “draft a kicker in the 7th round” kind of players
after some mulling i think the lions have to trade down, so my updated top 12 mock is as follows:
After that 2.87 mile run in the upper east side yesterday, I don’t blame him
After the “strongest out of conference schedule” thing I’m not sure
After the first guy all are open, then ones that are squares are the only ones that are opened/closed an even number of times.
After the fuckhole combine and the Beatdown in Beantown 
After the Tommy C shenanigans this team could’ve folded
After this election, I'm not sure campaign finance matters much at all
After this I tried to get a group to go celebrate in Boston Commons. Only taker was @Ayatollahzon. So that means we are two biggest FH Pats fans
After we have this discussion
After what happened to me against John, I have the right to be a bit apprehensive
After which we went on to win the 2nd of 3 World Series in 5 years
After work I'm down to do whatever, beside Times Square
After your BC football sadboy act earlier you deserve it
After your grandfather emigrated from Argentina in the 60s?
Afterward we can go out if people are still feeling up for it
Afterwards, everybody should go through at least one opponent (maybe the next in alphabetical order) and verify prices 
AG Sessions announced end of DACA literally last week!!! 
Again, didn't witness it but Luka and Brandon Ford both claim to have been there. But story is Anesto was boasting and Danny Luna ain't having it, says dude you suck I'll beat you 1v1. And Danny is not one who particularly cares about his health. So fresh off a blunt, Danny and Anesto square up. Apparently Anesto spent every possession trying to do some Allen Iverson shit and turned it over like every time. Danny just moved in slowly and was able to get a 6 footer every time and eventually made a few. At 7-0 Danny, they called the game and Anesto stormed off furious
Again, how is this not a parody account??
again, I’m not justifying another war. But it’s undeniable these countries are absolutely brutal regimes and they kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people, absolutely independent of the US 
Again, If you want to make a case to sway votes, do so at your pleasure. @Skimmer @Jamie Bourque @Marcus Bauer @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 
Again, I'm cool with +10 for now, but I'd advocate +15 for waivers next season
Again, I'm looking at this from a legal perspective. It's not the governments job to force people to believe one thing or another. That should be done by the national and local community. 
Again, maybe I'm completely missing the politics of recruiting and the like.
Again, the simplest and most effective step 1 it comes back to making colleges expenses cheaper, so tuition can be cheaper. Shift the subsidies from the student to the college
Agree
Agree
Agree
Agree
Agree 100% unfortunately 
Agree 1000%. Change the tax code and make it under 5 pages long.
Agree but we're okay settling for this
Agree buzzfeed historically is a joke when it comes to legit reporting. They actually came up though this election cycle. Their top guy Andrew Kazcynski got poached by CNN as a result
Agree Chan. Stephen A is the worst sports personality I can think of. 
Agree EPA/DB can very much be a team stat, which is why I like the CPOE+EPA/DB composite
Agree goodwin. But he’s the only candidate taking these ideas seriously, with a future-thinking mindset. And his ideas are wayyyy more fleshed out than Bernie. 
Agree he’ll be good but those salary numbers don’t feel good. Especially since Hyde just had a career best year 
Agree it’s a good movie but “my favorite movie is crazy stupid love” is gay as hell
Agree it’s Kamala’s to lose
Agree on preventative care (though I have little faith in people to keep themselves healthy). But you're just transferring those costs to the insurance company then, and then the insurance company would not cover the hospital if it loses money.
Agree Seahawks would’ve been THE snipe. But Jags was 2nd best (so far)
Agree split
"Agree that Ouzo
Vodka Power rankings :: Greece : European Country Power rankings"
Agree that the CFP has felt pretty blah even if it is “fairer”
Agree waiver rules need amending, but what I'm doing now is 100% within the rules. I was very persistent about getting rules established early in the season (and I still don't like them and all their bullshit contingencies), so I can work with it later. Like Joe said, most of these are likely inconsequential, but maybe we should actually get some legit keeper rules this offseason 
Agree wholeheartedly. It has descriptive legitimacy
Agree with barkus. I like plain vanilla fantasy football rules, plus .5 PPR and auction draft. No keepers, no two week playoff match ups, etc. just my input if it was up to me
Agree with Becker
Agree with Becker 
Agree with Chan and goody. That is a dream price for Wilson 
Agree with Chan. It’s more important than half the mandatory classes nowadays. Probably best to make it an auto-pass class, no tests or grades. Whether they retain it is on them. 
Agree with commissioner G
Agree with everything 
Agree with Goody on the HR number. Put down your manager's name (or someone who you know likes you), then put down HRs number. 
Agree with goody. All it is at Accenture is a flag that says referral. Doesn't matter who under almost all circumstances 
Agree with goody. But isn’t the hold up all about money, not this stuff?
Agree with Joe. And I do think DFS player count is highly concentrated on football, especially last 2 years
Agree with keeper rules 1 and 2. Don't like 3 and 4.  I think 3b and 4 are stretching too far to create more keepers, and 3a is only there to mitigate problems created by 3b and 4
Agree with Marcus on the Tom Cruise 🐐 take
Agree with the above. Also T Swift and Beyoncé 
Agree with the above. But the values listed are for 1QB leagues. For example the values show Rodgers going for $10. He will undoubtedly go for $30+ on draft day
Agree with them but Ichiro's 2000s Japan hits are definitely tougher than Rose's 60s/70s bits
Agree with top 3. Throw harden and the other usual suspects in there before kawhi IMO
Agree with trump on pulling out of the Iran deal. Iran got a bunch of frontloaded economic goodies, and agreed to shut down their nuclear program but also would be inspecting themselves and nobody else could inspect. IMO it was a disastrous deal from the start and pulling out has few negative consequences, if only because Iran’s opinion of the US couldn’t get worse anyway. 
Agree, more like “viral image seeking opportunist”. But American Tank Man makes antifa psychopath look spot on
Agree, only hardcore poem
Agree. I think the browns are poster child for the argument that tanking DOESNT work
Agree. In my head they’ve always had bad attitude guys and enabling coaches
Agree. Should've hit him in the face. 
Agree. Tyreek and Waddle are garbage 
Agree?
Agreed
Agreed
Agreed 
Agreed but still worth it
agreed with becker, once supply outweighs demand, you've basically hit the point where its not gonna get much better than that, so delaying reopening becomes indefinite
Agreed. Also Mel Kiper Jr. should've been on the fired list
Agreed. I can’t even use ethnic slurs toward my troops. PC culture has gone too far. 
Agreed. It affected my leg day workout pretty significantly 
Agreed. Steelers have so many more problems
Agreed. The Big Bang Theory and Nickelback are popular because they’re good
Ah
Ah alright yeah you're at page 11 then. The thing is monstrously huge. But you've read most of the best of it already. A lot of the rest is putting the Syria decisions into context.
Ah and the issue of net neutrality arises...
Ah as I was
Ah from climbing the Apps (that’s the appalachians for you city slickers)
Ah fuck that was gettable
Ah good old R Kelly, who sure is lucky as fucking hell that he was big before the #MeToo movement existed  
Ah gotcha
Ah gotcha yeah exactly 
Ah I see, first and fourth column.  Appears to be <10% for most guys
Ah it was a heart that showed up on my TL
Ah just wondering because lots of companies have training there, including mine. Last time I was in Chicago I was there for company training right after the San Francisco Giants won the 2014 World Series. It was pretty cool. 
Ah kind of a repeat of part 2 then
Ah must just be NL then
Ah my bad I forgot that you don’t bet to win money
Ah ok I wasn’t counting expenses 
Ah okay @Daz 4 Prez we'll go after this game
Ah rats well anyway it reaffirmed my opinion on why Rubio is by far the best candidate for the presidency. One of his highlights was a long complex discussion about encryption and back doors, re the whole Apple-Govt iPhone backdrop issue. Contrast it with Hillary who literally can't access her email without help. 
Ah right
Ah right with their only 2 wins against the Ners
Ah shit you're right
Ah shit. Welp it’s over for me guys.
Ah so it’s because it’s something a lot of people like. #neverchange
Ah so that's why the Ners are 0-7
Ah so the kelleher plan is already partially in effect. Just need to expand the fuck out of those programs
Ah then she's way out of my league
Ah thx
Ah well thanks Jamie and goodie. I've been a SB Nation guy for years but I'm getting sick of their SJW-ness so looking to switch
Ah yeah that sucks. Wonder what your rights are to refuse 
Ah yes, they've been really keen on universal basic income recently
Ah you were saying don't do that, so it's okay. I get it. Sorta funny. Like 2/10
Ah you're right, those are the next to eliminate 
Ah. Agreed
Ah. Just wondering because you bring it up from time to time

Ahh ok not really into getting into an Internet flame war though...
Ahh shame since you were participating so much beforehand
Ahh so like in a "Tannehill will never see my starting lineup again" sort of way?
Ahh thanks, I distinctly remember watching him and thinking he was a liability last 2 years
Ahh yeah you always were more of a links player
Ahhh fuck I knew that
Ahhhh good one thx for the reminder
Ahhhh I'm so excited for fantasy :D
Ahhhh Pam, good memories 
Ahhhh shit your hype man is on fire!!! Don't worry Chan I'm gonna step it up!!
Ahhhhh I couldn't resist 
Ahhhhh so the truth comes out
Ahhhhh that feels good
Ahhhhh yes he did!!!!!!

Airlines and other companies pay a lot to answer your “I (metaphorically) bet” question, and so far they’ve all concluded that the a la carte option with the lowest price is the best option
Airlines are giving customers what they want (cheapest possible seats) and people have the option to pay more for comfort, but they never do. They just bitch.

All I know for sure is that if the lab coat bois make another effective vaccine tomorrow, the CDC won’t authorize it for 6 months

All I know is if the lakers win and Joe tries to back out of our bet, I’m sending him to the gulag
All I know is Terrance Williams deserves a 1 seed in the 🐐 tournament 
All I know is that formula one in Jeddah while the Houthi missiles are flying is the closest we may ever get to Mario kart blue shells 
All I know is that this is an opportunity to get even more juice when we thought the squeeze was squoze

All in all this feels like a watershed period for the the world security order, in that the nebulous specter of the Russian threat is now proven real, and NATO appears to temporarily be strengthening and unifying, where it has felt in decline for a decade

All of Reddit politics is among the dumbest and most circlejerkest communities I've ever experienced. The sensationalism of most of the posts and comments are straight ridiculous. It's actually painful to read and realize how many people believe that nonsense
All of the commenters were saying that before the game
All of the mod next to yalls has seen my genitals
All of them
All of this is way worse for the public sector believe it or not lol
All of those guys were pass catching backs supplementing a great WR corps and a more traditional early down back. The Niners have neither, yet continue to go after RBs.
All of those teams have had bad games...
All of us rn
All other details are accurate
All rise 
"All smart election analysts: Exit polls are meaningless and give false senses of confidence

All that would be required is for a med lab employee to propose it on a webinar to doctors across the country, and they would immediately see the genius that is the Kelleher Plan. Too bad none of those opportunities exist
All that's missing is "the crab cakes were exquisite"
All the -115s are even on both sides. I’ll take the juice cut if you’re feeling generous
All the above is true, but a bit more context: historically most of the presidents nominees require the 60 vote minimum. In 2013, the Senate pulled the "nuclear option" (so only simple majority is required) for all of those nominees, with the exception of the Supreme Court. This move today extends it to the Supreme Court. 
All the above. Also unlimited laser printing in my apartment complex where I have a corner unit with a fountain view 
All the daily leagues use .5 PPR. Every league worth its salt uses some form of PPR
All the excitement has been replaced by salt
All the FLB videos 
All the martell shit that happened in book 4 seems to be replaced completely
All the playoffs tho
All the talent you could ask for. Zero leadership, constant whiner, rolls eyes at legitimate criticism, demands constant praise, will always be a huge loser. 
All the UFC had to do was bring Khabib into the same room and Conor stopped his rampage and ran away
All their holiday episodes are the best
All these flat routes, screens, wheels, and shallow crosses. Two downfield shots, one holding and one TD

Almost at the halfway point btw. This is when academics ends and we start to get to do real military stuff. Next week we have an expeditionary course and a evacuation wargaming exercise, then the following week is our mock deployment
Almost certainly did. Kid can throw a dart anywhere and it’ll be a bullseye
Almost every keeper has been totally worth it besides (IMO) Luck, Bell, Henry, Freeman, Dalvin, and Fournette
Almost every one of my scores is between 90 and 105
Almost?
ALOLbama
ALOLBAMA
ALOLbama
along that line i've hung out with yall plus Katelynn friend group 20+ times and have never become friends with any of them
Alongside the Pats victory, Jets loss, Kirk win, and Jameis win, it has been an incredible weekend for the good guys
Already cooking
Already living rent free in their head. We got this locked up
Already proved that with my political predictions 
Alright Aaron Rodgers here’s your chance
Alright BC no flags here
Alright boys I’m out of here 🇺🇸 
Alright drew lock, time to put on for your city and win this game
Alright hold your horses there cowboy let's get a couple 7 win seasons first before we even think about a 10 win season
Alright I booked. If anybody is later than me and wants to split, let me know lol
Alright I’m out motherfuckers ✌🏼
Alright I’m outta here boys
Alright let’s add it to the list
Alright maybe capitalism was a mistake
Alright now we’ll see. This is the exact situation where punting and going 3 and out worked
Alright so “good but not great night for the Rs” is the Marcus take. Can’t say I disagree
Alright well I'll be with Taylor and Luka and we're prob just gonna go out somewhere if folks wanna join
Alrighty Friday 8/28 at 9pm confirmed 
Alshon come on bruh
Also "I don't need daily intel briefings"
Also "needs the money" is some Latrelle Spreewell shit hahaha
Also "the CIA and FBI are liars, Russia never tried to influence the election, but 3 million illegals definitely voted to cheat me"
Also "why aren't I 50 points ahead" today. May or may not be a lasting trope 
Also #tbt to Jai Alai
Also #tbt to when Kunks' parents show up and he didn't warn us at all and I'm mid sesh in the "no smoking" chamber, and he knocks and says please stop....
Also $20
Also @Boe Jourque and @#JustFacts✅ i will collect my winnings at your earliest convenience 
Also @Joe Bourque that article on going for 2 is another perfect example of that possession bias we were talking about. It does mathematically make sense to go for 2 every time by expected points added, but coaches feel like they already have the 1 point guaranteed with a PAT. 
Also @Joff Savarino is there a brunch on Sunday ?
Also @Legitimate Business Man I’m pretty sure it’s John, given that Kevin currently has the rona 
Also @Skimmer in pole position to win fantasy baseball

Also ❄️ take: PKs are dumb and should be replaced with a 3 on 2 opportunity for 20 seconds 
Also 0 dingers since that 2 HR day so pretty sad over here
Also 2/4
Also a little surprised the QB/WR transition guys aren’t on there, like Terrell Pryor or Jakobi Meyers
Also a non-player, but I’m awake and I watch a ton of Xs and Os tape... yes absolutely, depends on the gap fit by the defense
Also a striking contrast in US-UK alliance from just a few years ago. Clinton - Blair and Bush - Blair were peas in a pod. Obama and Cameron hate each other. The US has been completely silent on the whole ordeal. 
Also a terrible game planner
Also a ton of Vegas billets btw 
Also a top post on CFB shows that every playoff has had 3/4 of Bama, OSU, Clemson, and Oklahoma, with the 4th team never more than once 
Also according to the president in his interview with Chris Wallace, europe is actually just as bad but they don’t test so their numbers are artificially low
Also adds context to the recent feud with Turkey
Also again FWIW McConnell supposedly never liked kavanaugh 
Also agree Rome was buns
Also AJ McCarron named his kid Cash so fuck that guy
Also all the songs were 2 mins long
Also all those shirts have sleeves and collars. Dislike.

Also almost named after a legendary Pokémon 
Also also a $10 bet is about putting skin in the game behind your claims. Not in it for the money
Also also can somebody please bring up DACA / govt resuming in your other groupme because I wanna see Erin/Vinny go bananas
Also also I’m going back to day shift next week, so if we have to reschedule the draft, I can do weekday nights 
Also also LMAO Mr Met
Also also LOL Michael Thomas isn’t that good Jesus fucking Christ 
Also an athletes interview of the event, easy parts and challenges, how you mentally fared, etc
Also an electronic musician
Also an important caveat would be if you could pocket unused draft money year over year, like cap space
Also Andy Reid was considered elite or very close to it before the chiefs 
Also another amazing ACC victory with Cal over their SEC opponent
Also another note: the injury cutoff I looked at is 15 games
Also any girl can gain or lose 2 points based on how much effort they put in
Also anybody notice that the GOP Town Halls are segregated by race?
Also apparently aerodactyl isn’t a dragon even tho he’s on Lances team wtf
Also apparently one of Fox News’ biggest stars is now a Bernie bro 🤔
Also apparently the white WRs have disappeared and I’ve totally missed that happening 
Also Arlington is more than ok
Also as expected we failed to come up with a last place punishment list so that’s gone too
Also as of today I’m officially a 1st Lieutenant 
Also Australia rn
Also basketball is the (usually) only sport where a single guy can absolutely take over
Also Bean Dad had one weird anti-Semitic seeming tweet that got dug up. He has since deleted his account. 
Also because Kanye hasn't released good shit since Cruel Summer
Also becker for most likely to get into a great interaction with steve Harvey 
also becker our trump finishing the term bet is only $20
also Becker saying "i don't care" has aged... poorly...
Also becker soccer is a friggin cash cow worldwide. Idk the money behind cricket, but I bet it's paltry compared to soxcer 
Also Becker Trump is actually significantly more "moderate" than it might appear. His views change so often and so drastically, and they're so inconsistent with each other that he doesn't really fit anywhere on the traditional left-right spectrum 
Also becker you drafted him for $12 lmao how can you chirp
Also Becker, pls tell me your rant on NBA coaching last night was trolling
Also becker: “Typo” LMAOOOOO GOT HEEEEEEM
Also been trying to come up with one for the Andes mountains for years
Also Bernie doesn’t donate Jack shit
Also bet the chiefs wish they didn’t cut Kareem Hunt

Also big yikes for James and Kat
Also big yikes for TCU not making the list 
Also big yikes for the other allied troops who are stationed here
Also big yikes on that typo

Also Bills punter is literally named @Boe Jourquez
Also Bradley Beal just open palm punched draymond and they both got ejected. And also inches from a Houston grand slam
Also Brady might never throw another TD
Also Brazil is getting hit super hard and could be on track to be worst in the world. 
Also brutal crosswordle today
Also BxR > BxB
also CA with two surprising non-progressive results on props: Uber is saved, and racial preferential treatment fails
Also Calvin Harris, Michael Bay, Adam Levine, Guy Fieri, Trey Parker...
Also Cam is the NFLs biggest star
Also can always chuck it up and hope for PI
Also can never forget when we set off the fire alarm in Connor/Pomps room, then immediately cleaned up and moved to 38A... only to set off the fire alarm there within 5 minutes 😂😂😂
Also can we please quickly appreciate that Hue wanted to give up a 2nd and 3rd for McCarron who is still a FA
Also can we please send out keeper values soon?
Also can’t help but love the total 180 by the inventor of “this is literally what you signed up for”
Also carted off doesn’t necessarily mean shit in camp. They cart people off for sneezing too hard
Also ceviche for nice meal
Also check @👀  out here hating on child benefits and scorning unapproved small money wagers. Has he joined @#JustFacts✅  in becoming a Republican??
also check Kevin Durant the Selfless giving up easy money to keep the team together. What a generous and loyal teammate
Also check out the Gers beating a CFP finalist lmao
Also check out this headline from a SJW site 
also check out this photo of @#JustFacts✅  in 5 years
Also check this insight into the classy local football fans of Alamogordo NM 
Also checking into report dingers went  5-8 with 1 HR in the opening tourney. Bad news, all 3 outs were pop ups
Also Chris sales last start... holy bananas
Also Christian Yelich $290/7 extension damn bruh 
Also circling back the cap % speculation was clearly wrong
Also Classic SJW argument, revolves around "I think..." and presents not a single piece of data
Also code pink is funded by China 
Also commercials been lackluster so far
Also commish, where are the post draft power rankings?
Also could've sat Bruce and locked up Ks. Probably should've done that but I doubt it will matter long term
Also D would need LM permission 
Also darrow you're totally wrong, Thomas Kemper is the best root beer
Also dealt brieda and goodwin
Also decriminalization != legalization
Also depending on his performance we can call him Dank Herb or Schwab Herb
Also depends on the weekend but probably in
Also did anybody just see Kyle Lowry?!?!
Also did the reverse hands putting grip and plumb bobbing
Also didn’t you just say the OS is being scrapped
Also doctors my mom just got her legs taken out by a running dog and landed right on her lower back and says her spine hurts, is otherwise fine tho. Any advice? Ice/heat?
Also don’t have an Xbox 
also don’t look now but the Giants are looking to sweep the Bums tn after outscoring them 22-5 in the first 2 games
also dont forget about the draft $ changes tab
Also don't see Big Ben over Cam. Experience is the only thing he has an advantage in
also double check your prices. im pretty confident i got them right but i did do them all in a single session so i'd appreciate a second set of eyes
Also Doug martins 251/4 + 21 is 6th all time for RBs
Also down for that
Also down to watch football Sunday 
Also DPOY contender
Also Draymond gets a T for stomping in anger but Lebron is fucking Tarzan on the rim and that's fine
Also ELOLn musk
Also emyr hasn’t responded, but I say we assume gronk replaces Kelce (only TE), and Cooks replaces Edelman (only eligible WR)
Also Emyr is likely to quit the league unless it changes to PPR, so that's another annoying twist to this whole fiasco
Also Emyr told me he’s not going to reunion so calling on the FH to try change his mind
Also European plumbing is far inferior and they can't handle the amount of toilet paper we Free Folk use
Also every single person is white
Also everybody else had taken multiple punishment pegs and not complained
Also everybody smokes. And the cities are small, even Dublin was smaller than I thought
Also exactly the same style of attack as the Ohio State failed attacker
Also extremely strict discipline, both for himself and his kids. 
Also falls under the budget reconciliation rule, which expires end of the month
Also false, I view it in terms of gambling too
Also fantasy league members, we should schedule a time to discuss league rules. We can do it right here in chat, but i want to schedule a time because I want everybody to have their voice and vote represented
Also fight club doesn’t set up that is gonna have a twist. Like some movies (shutter island comes to mind) basically throw “there’s gonna be a twist, can you guess what it is?!” In your face and fight club doesn’t do that
Also finally saw the last Jedi. Thought one of the storylines was good and one was crap. Will avoid spoilers unless everybody has seen it
Also finna throw up a preemptive LOLtre Dame at risk of being wrong
Also first ever dumbass puking drunk night in high school was from Capt Mo
Also FLOLrida State
Also for as much shit as the Falcons get for pulling out miracle losses, they're ahead of the Jags and Chargers in difference vs Pythagorean record
Also for the non intelligentsia in here, FYSA I just got a GroupMe message that I won a free iPad. So watch out for those scams, since I know people might be prone to falling for them
Also for the older side, a 41 year old wants to bang me
Also former BC RB Jon Hilliman takes the mantle as the Gi”LOL”ants RB2 behind Gallman
Also Foxcatcher was a low key unsettling but good movie 
Also from what I've observed of my coworkers, Indians are very unexpressive so that datapoint was surprising to me
Also fun fact Arab numerals were actually invented by Hindu Indians. They were used by Arabs, then learned by Fibonacci who popularized them in Europe  
Also fun fact my childhood friend married lew wolffs grandson
Also fun fact the taliban were the good guys in Rambo 3 lmao
Also fun fact: the batter during the famous pitch was Kyler Murray’s dad
Also fwiw, my base is 99% vaccinated and have gone from 2 cases to 50 cases in 3 days. 
Also gave me (my dad) a baseball when I was 2 years old
Also give me Joe Burrow +2500 lead the league in passing yards $10, if you can stomach it. 
Also Goff has been trash for 2 of his 3 years 
Also gonna skip season 2 to spare my blood from boiling. This next one sounds a lot like season 1
Also good but low floor: kiwi
Also Goodwin I have DMC as my insurance policy, which is no Zeke, but it's not like that spot becomes an empty black hole
Also Goodwin this is why the dry cleaning is so expensive
Also goodwin you totally missed a shot at bringing back “diagon alley” there
Also goody apparently AKA has been around since the late 80s and is the oldest top MMA gym in the US I can find
Also goody I'm not as convinced every player wants to win. I'm convinced they want to score, but not necessarily win. 
Also goody it's playoff berth, not birth you fucking moron
Also goody there's a vid on /r/MMA right now that all good leg kick finishes in UFC history
Also Goodys solo Edward 40hands was classic
Also got breakfast anonymously bought for me so that was pretty cool
Also got my wisdom teeth out yesterday 
Also gotta go with the shiny new thing. Certainly not a raptor after such grandiose demonstrations of how big of a raptors fan he is
also gotta love the classic "let's take OBJ and Bell's values in their potential 6th year of being keepers and use that to justify this gobbledygook" trademark goodwin logic 
also gotta see what the rhyme was before passing judgement. if its a great rhyme (like stars and thars), it gets a pass
Also guarantee Don couldn't point to Kurdistan on a map
Also guarantee half that stuff gets thrown away within 2 weeks 
Also guys I need to get a job. I was going to just walk into bars/restaurants around the neighborhood and ask to be a waiter/bar back. Would any of y’all do anything different?
Also Hanley is a bum
Also happy covfefe everybody
Also happy preseason kickoff
Also happy valentines to us #foreveralone losers. Happy to Dutch rudder with any of you today
Also hardbody John using his hardbody to seduce the women, then wishing he could transfer some hardness from his abs to his weewee 
Also hatched a charmander this morning :D
Also hate playing through
Also hate reacted 
Also have to add in A Few Good Men
Also have to shout out booger for saying they should run a sneaky draw play, then spike it next down. It was 3rd down. 
Also he could've easily tied the single game threes record (12), but he didn't even take another shot after his 11th three
Also he fucking plugs shit between the Qs. I hate this man so much 
Also he shouldn’t have raped people
Also he’s still “working on” book SIX, so the ending still has over a thousand pages left (should work out to about 37 years of writing)
Also helps Cruz since he was trending down for the past 2 weeks
Also Herbert just had a record rookie season and Lock is the worst QB in the league
Also here for it
Also highly ironic: the ACC pulled all of its championships from NC because of the anti transgender bathroom law. Where is the ACC headquartered? Greensboro, NC. 
Also hilarious how much controversy there has been when they're by far the best team in the East and will almost surely go to the finals
Also how appropriate that Eli made it one round more than Peyton
Also how bout a FH gathering for the super bowl? 
also how hilarious is it that during quarantine, nobody is rewatching GoT because S8 was just THAT bad
Also I ❤️ Anthony Scaramucci
Also I argue that Drew Brees is one of the most overrated QBs in NFL history. Meaning he's solid, but not much better than the top 10 each year and certainly not close to the Brady Manning tier.
Also I bet you AB outscores thielen ROS
Also I can’t imagine the UFC liking funky Ben. Guy is a dominant wrestler but that’s about it and the UFC hates those guys 
Also I didn’t realize at the time, but goody and my map are off by a single Nebraska district. 
Also I didn't bring it up in here. You did lol
Also I don’t think this area is important per se, just that it would be a win and the Russians need one bad 
Also I expect everybody to have gotten yesterday’s Heardle in 1
Also I finished The Improvement Association podcast so if anybody wants to talk about that, estoy aqui
Also I got JJ Watts  haircut because I hate you that much 
Also i hate to be a wet blanket but no way is this an actual MMA style fight. Guarantee there are a million conditions that make it lame
Also i have a friend who can only attend a bachelor party or the wedding itself, but not both. Which would you attend if you were him?
Also I have never once been a hypocrite when it comes to payment
Also I have so far been right that drew lock is absolute trash
Also I have to delay it a week or so because military is being lame
Also I heard Serial is amazing but I've never listened to it myself
Also I hope Sessions’ case is a message to every politician who praises trump. It is always a one way street, he will never repay the favor unless it helps himself, and he will turn on you at the drop of a pin. 
Also I hope the inventors middle name was Ray because then he'd be Carl Rat Jepsson
Also I joined team red #valor #gryffindor #pms fuck team blue and yellow
Also I just booked a trip to Thailand
Also I looked up the specifics of Latino American demographics. 60-65% Mexican. Puerto Rican’s are the second most at about 10%, then Cuban, Salvadoran, Dominican, and Guatemalan make up 2-3% each. 
Also I love how the good doctor trans post guy is just randomly shirtless lmao
Also I love how the tankie vid argument tacitly implies that when prices are low, it’s because the corporations are all separately feeling generous 
Also I love showing up looking like a scrub and then exceeding the haters’ expectations 
Also I love telling greek people that Turkish food is great and vice versa
Also I love the implication that wearing a medical mask is the same as a sheisty to the cops 
Also I love these falcons blacks
Also I might have to add remember the titans alongside field of dreams in the “sports drama” category 
Also i must be super high on Taylor relative to y’all 
Also I need a new 56 so if you wanna go on a date to a golf store and hit the track man, I’d enjoy that 
"Also I need a new pair of headphones.
Does anybody have a recommendation for one that is good for running"
Also I read a fascinating study on coin flip probability last night. If the coin is allowed to drop and fall on the floor, pick tails since heads is heavier, and if the coin happens to roll on its side, it will more likely fall heavy side down. If the coin is caught, pick the side that was up during flipping (let's say heads). The reason for this is because the coin can never flip to the opposite side (tails) more times than the head side. Ex) H T H T H T H T... there is never a time where T occurs more than H, but there are times where H occurs more than T. Thus, H is <1% more likely to occur than T, if the coin starts on heads. If the coin is caught and flipped on reveal, then of course pick the face down side
Also I read an opinion piece that said the banging was used most and most effective with relievers in high leverage situations. High leverage is obvious, but also relievers usually only have 2, mayybe 3 pitches. 
Also I read Knicks offered melo for Kevin love
Also I see automation of jobs as analogous to the Amazon HQ thing, where a lot of people will be screwed but it’s better for the public as a whole, and trying to stop it is counterproductive 
Also I see the midge is still around, but the ladies are not
Also I Stan for jelly beans 
Also I successfully got under the 160 mark this morning. Jeff if I can do it you can ( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼
Also I think goodwin might be number 2 in the best hair power rankings
Also I think it’s funny that the Cole Beasley white guy is overrated because he’s white, but also the actually good white WRs are underrated because they’re White, like Jordy Nelson and Adam thielen 
Also I think the consensus was that Jamie's team was the best immediately post draft, just to demonstrate how expectations =/= reality
Also I think this is the first time joe has referred to himself in the third person
Also I thought babe Ruth had highest career WAR just because of how dominant he was for his time
Also I thought universities were tax exempt?
Also I totally believe contacting a congressperson is a big deal. They probably have an understanding that if 1 person calls, 1000 people feel the same way
Also I was looking at Ted Williams career stats today. Hard to put him below top 5 hitters of all time...
Also I was prevented from hearting and got this?
Also I was really interested in what @🎳 thinks his dumbest moment at BC was
Also I watched like 5 warriors games all season so admitted fake fan here
Also I went to a BC game watch bar in Manhattan on Saturday. Apparently the polo hat, Patagonia vest over a blue gingham button down, pastel khakis and boat shoes look doesn't fade away when you graduate
Also I will prob attend a different tailgate since I wanna see Pat and Taylor and Brooke and them. 
Also I would totally lay pipe on Danielle if just for the sheer excitement. Sounds like a ball of fire that one
Also I’d call up the leader of half Asians Keanu Reeves and chill with him while he saves us all. I’d probably die heroically while he just fails to save me at the last second, but maybe I’d get a cool memorial or something
Also I’d like to think we, as 27+ year old grown men, wouldn’t repeatedly do something just to annoy others. But I am unfortunately aware of the present company. 
Also I’d take Kirk Cousins over most of the QBs on that list, especially the ones who’ve never thrown an NFL pass or had half a good season
Also I’m ashamed of Bernie Sanders criticizing Maduro, proving that he’s no different than evil Trump and Rubio and not a true socialist like he said he was
Also I’m coming into Boston on Thursday so if anybody wants to hang out. I know most of y’all are flying the next day
Also I’m doing a 3 week assignment to the med group so I’ll get a taste of what you doctor nerds deal with
Also I’m doing really well in fanduel best balls so far
Also I’m never sure whether to treat the Jews as a persecuted minority or privileged white people. It’s really a topic of debate. I call it “The Jewish Question”. 
Also I’m not reading all 1000 messages from past 2 weeks so I miss anything good?
Also I’ve never heard of Alex Tingle in my life 
Also I’ve never met the kid so yeah
Also I’ve successfully made my entire flight say Wendy’s/Dragons/Bofa jokes 
Also ice cold take, but I bet that this year, the Warriors do not chase 72/73/74 and focus all effort on the postseason 
Also Idaho/Montana
Also idk if y'all saw this photo, but wow...
Also if any of y'all played Halo Reach, but Rogue One and Reach are about identical in many aspects, including much of the plot, timing, and setting
Also if any of you Fuckholes want to do a golf trip this summer I'm totally down 
Also if any of your wives are into this stuff I would value their input more than y’all’s 
Also if anyone wants a free 2 month gym membership I have one at the gym next to my/johns apt
Also if GRRM finishes TWOW
Also if he gave himself a gimme chip in, that means he also must’ve been at least lying par on that hole. Which means he would’ve needed to up and down for double bogey
Also if John beats me I'm gonna protest that it was because of racism 
Also if rich people can pay their way to the front of the line. Like if the vaccine costs $20 and 10,000 people were willing to pay $5000 to jump the line, it would be tough for the state to turn that down from a financial perspective.
Also if this trip is happening, it better be more than just going to the BC game (with all due respect to future 10-2 BC)
Also if you don’t buy your router and rent it from the cable company, it’s often limited to 40. So it doesn’t matter if you buy 50, 100, 200, the lim factor is the router. 
Also if you have a locked in top ~6 QB, you pay them whatever they ask for
Also if you haven’t read Gen. Mattis statement today it’s worth 3 minutes  
Also if you want I can throw a resume into Accenture for you. No guarantees you'll like the job, but I can help
Also if you’re 6 feet and there a 6’9 guy guarding you, he could give you like 8 feet of space and still block your shot
Also if you’re hitting your max speed, it’s gonna be relatively accurate
Also if your “real league” has people trading goff for adams, it’s not a real league
Also I'm a masochist so I enjoy delving into topics that greatly depress me
Also I'm gonna lose to Kevin for the second straight week
Also Im never ever explicitly mean to Gordon on ask fm. I'm probably his biggest supporter actually. I laughed at some of the questions I posted 2 years ago that he answered today
Also imagine going to Cal and not caring about CFB
Also in "not surprising whatsoever but now here's data to prove it" news, Trump supporters are generally racist, homophobic, and/or generally bigoted 
Also in healthcare policy news, remember the AHCA bill that passed the House and then trump threw a celebration party in the rose garden? Now he says it sucks and it's "mean mean mean" (supposedly he actually said that)
also in the image that shotgun is either a single or double barrel with no mag, reloading is gonna be a major issue against multiple targets
Also in the top 20 are Trent Dilfer, John smoltz, Aaron Rodgers, Eric Gagne, Steph Curry, Carson Palmer, Greg Maddux, and Adam Theilen
Also inline with the 2nd category, there is an incumbency disadvantage nowadays, across pretty much every western country
Also insane they had Nabers BTJ like 3 years later
Also interested in JBJ
Also interesting fact about campaign financing. In 2014 midterms, outside groups spent $8.2 million. This year, it’s $30.1 million 😳
Also ironic because I inquired about trading for Wilson as a keeper and exchanging money and he said “nah I’d rather keep the money”
Also Irving is my favorite character 
Also is it really gonna be called Life of Pablo?
Also is it truly “seasonal” like your example or is it waves every few months unrelated to actual weather?
Also is nobody going to comment on the insane Sox Yanks game yesterday
Also is nobody gonna comment on button down and no pants goodwin?
Also islands
Also Israel going bananas past 24 hours
Also it’s in the constitution so conservative originalists should really take a seat on this one
Also it’s ironic that the consensus #2 fantasy picks in back to back years have missed the entire season 
Also it’s not on an album but fourfiveseconds is a top 5 Kanye song
Also it’s possible we’re past the peak of the third wave 
Also it’s possible you could rent your condo to me under favorable prices in return for me being the ideal tenant. 
Also it’s pretty ironic that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” but “Donald Trump is my brother”
Also it’s trite but it’s true: If Israel laid down their weapons, they would all be dead in a week. 
Also it’s wild to say but $265/5 with $185 guaranteed will probably be a middle of the pack QB deal in like 2 years 
Also I've never seen this until yesterday, but it's the most explicitly (vs implicitly) racist trump comment I've heard so far
Also I've read that medical staff, equipment, and insurance are universally the biggest expenditures for football teams
Also I've sent the last 5 messages with zero response. Come on guys you're making me feel like Becker 
Also james harden must be pissed that the NBA is cracking down on shooting intentionally into a foul
Also Jason Kidd fired 
Also Jeff, who would your pick for TotF be from here on out? You even get 6 weeks of season play
Also joe “if you ever want to make my career progression” is the whitest thing you’ve ever said
"Also joe and I made a $20 bet:
I win if Amari Cooper is WR8 or better"
Also joe I'm a heat fan now remember? 11 straight baby!
Also Joe sorry about last night. But bout that time to change your name 
Also Joe this coming season^
Also Joe, 538 has a good article on delegate math and it basically says Cruz is screwed and Rubio has a shot for as long as there is a race. Cruz winning Oklahoma is huge for him though
Also John, how do you not know the legend of Gordon Callender aka Anesto Callender aka Anesto Cubano aka The Edit Gness?
Also Jon Jones arrested again lmao
Also Jordan Poole is the Jameis of the NBA
Also Josh Jackson pretended to shoot a fan yesterday
Also Julio Franco 
Also just realized it would be pretty easy to get nudes of literally anybody with polyjuice potion lmao 
Also KD is a top 4 all time player (though some haters dispute that) and he gets a ton of hate
Also Kershaw and David Price have massive contracts from a few years ago so I’ll guess one of those 2
Also Kevin great reference
also kickers will be either scoring changed or omitted
Also kinda obvious now but the whole Niners Jones thing was in fact a smoke screen
Also Klay is that dude in pickup who immediately shoots everytime he touches the ball. Except he can actually shoot. 
Also LA doesn't give a shit about the Rams
Also last time Reddit bitched this much was about net neutrality, which they lost and it ended up being literally no different
also leftists^
Also legit curious, what's their view on TFA?
Also legit question: could the warriors starting 5 beat the All NBA first team?
Also let’s not forget the NYT has published pieces in the past year by Erdogan, Putin, and the goddamn Taliban 
Also let's be honest here. What's more likely: Trump enjoys golden showers, or trump DOESNT enjoy golden showers?
Also like overtly in with the Russian Mob / Govt 
Also liked driving around BC in his convertible blasting music just to be seen
Also literally 95% of the jerseys there were of players not on the current team
Also literally us
Also live look at me
Also lmao at Becker being upset at the dirty mirror after we all talked about how lazy we are with menial tasks literally a few hours ago
Also lmao at the juxtaposition 
Also lmao remember the Colorado roller coaster
Also LOL
Also LOL at Jacob’s and Dimes getting 5th year option declined
Also LOL at not having JT out there at RB with the season on the line after the whole fiasco early this season
Also lol at the Rd 1 pick swap for GB to jump literally only the Pats 
Also lol Gurley smart football play to not score, and a giant middle finger to fantasy owners who needed that
Also lol only time in sports where you win and lose fans
Also lol remember Megan fox?
Also lol that Devin Bookers was a loss
Also lol that Native American protestor dude ends up being a fake Vietnam Vet
Also lol they had dez 
Also lol universal healthcare paying for us smokers thanks losers
Also lolMarcus
Also look at lacrosse
Also looked it up. Becker do you call 20 foot putts gimmes too?
Also looking at that era's Yankees roster... That might be one of the best dynasties of all time. 
Also looking at the photo I guess they took a $3.25 processing fee...
Also looks like Samsung is gonna buy out Tidal and Jay Z is just gonna eat a few hunnid million dolla loss
Also looks like the write in vote percentage will exceed the margin of victory. Those are likely republicans who voted for neither
Also love all the backfield movement on the run plays
Also love how Kirk has totally embraced his Kirk-ness and everybody loves him for it, whereas Russ still pretends to be a cool guy and everybody hates him
Also love the excuse of “sorry for the mixup I was grinding too hard”
Also LSU raking in a filthy recruiting class again. Smart move not firing Les Miles
Also make sure you print your boarding pass ahead of time. I remember those who tried to print at the airport got charged like $50
Also man that mattison 4th down rush was Trent Richardson esque too. There was a gap 3 bodies wide right of the lead block, instead he ran right into his full backs ass
Also Manafort is cooperating holy balls hahahaha
Also manny machado is a piece of shit
Also marathon fuel. Kristen knows
Also Marcus lapped the field in club heads pounded into the turf
Also Marcus you forgot the trump kids 
Also Marlon Mack should be $13
Also Massachusetts is one of the most Trump-favorable states in the country, so good job morons
Also memory is good because it makes it be shorter. Nobody has ever said “man I wish that best man speech was longer”
Also Michael Cohen just got 3 years
Also might be the only instance of you being in better shape than your pro athlete doppelgänger 
Also Mike Evans is the quietest first ballot hall of famer I’ve ever seen
Also missing from jeffs answer was that Mike Pence publicly said Flynn never talked with Russia, which has since been proven a lie. So either Flynn lied to Pence, or Pence lied for Flynn. And whether trump knew about it is still unknown 
Also more SJW media being super rational of course:
Also most people have realized by now that you’ll get called racist for everything and any overtures (genuine or token) will never be enough 
Also my fav professor from BC Chris Maxwell did some ticket revenue forecasting for Stern, Stern didn't like the result so he didn't pay him. 
Also my name is “Dingers”
also need to mention that hamas purposely puts rocket infrastructure and other warfighting capabilities in civilian areas like hospitals and schools
Also Nets couldn’t be better timing with the KD injury recovery
Also never saw it. But the point was having Coach Carter on top 7 sports movies of all time is certainly a take. 
Also new Hardcore History
Also no becker, surprisingly
Also no shot I am gonna watch the whole video. So I’m happy for u. Or sorry that happened. 
Also no Tristan wirfs
Also nobody is missing Jamie Collins hahaha
Also not denying my ranking, but it’s interesting that I’m probably one of the most anti-Trump people here, and yet I’m #2 conservative 
Also not mentioned yet but Cal and Stanford are in the same group with VTech
Also not only did they get Sam Darnold, but the panthers also signed Dan Arnold 🤔 
Also not problematic per se but goodys troll about Vinny’s wedding was a top tier moment 
Also not vacant but LOL raiders. They’ve been in a garbage spot for a decade.
Also nothing proven but a lot of allegations that the UFC is in deep with fixed matches
Also OBJ and Landry reunited. Suck that tiger dick bitch
Also Odds Pats draft QB
Also off topic but this is amazing:
Also one of mine is XL, does that mean anything?
Also only 1 WR in Rd 1 seems ambitious... idk what odds you’re getting on that
Also our defensive scoring is non standard but I don’t think anybody has issues with that
Also outback steaks are decent in my experience 
Also PA is ironically the slowest counter of literally all the states, and says they may not know until Friday.
Also paramour and Tyler the creator would be a show
Also party elites is the wrong term; it's more just an overarching term for influential people inside or outside the party. Shaun King would likely be considered a "party elite" since his opinion influences the viewpoint of large portions of black people. 
Also Philly showing once again why they’re the worst fan city in the world by booing their team during game 1 of the playoffs 
Also pitch clock gamesmanship by the pitcher 
Also plan on being there. Would need a becker ride
Also playoff baseball in person truly feels different. A 1-0 game into the 7th is boring in the regular season and electric in the playoffs. 
Also please note Jeff "Lucky Charms" Savarino up there
Also pls don't repeat the Jenn story too far and wide, and if you must, you didn't hear it from me
Also possible Ners were getting offers from other teams and TB couldnt let that happen 
Also possible. I think we should do something like: pick 3 games against the spread each week, best final record wins 
Also pretty good at softball
Also pretty solid season on best ball
Also probably the most overrated QB of all time 
Also props for being able to pony up again after that Chiefs game... I'm still incredulous
Also pundits are saying Nets got fleeced too since late first round is barren
Also punter. Big yikes 
Also question for y’all. I’m planning on signing up for Mass Health for 2 months. That’s the best plan right?
Also question is open to all, not just Jeff 
also questionable phrasing for marcus to request the "full clip"
Also quick plug for a SUCK IT DODGERS
Also r/lotrmemes is a goldmine
Also random chance any of you know someone looking to sublet a room I can rent in the NYC/NJ area from July to October, that'd be very helpful 
Also re foreign music, check this song. It's an Italian song that's supposed to sound like English to a non English speaker 
Also RE the draft, this group biases my expectations that people know more about sports than they actually do. Stuff like knowing the details of a marquee trade or contract are common knowledge in here, and like 2% in the real world
Also re: me vs nick, we literally went outside so it was clearly a fight 
Also re: the odds/moneyline, i think bookies prefer to use moneyline because showing odds makes it more obvious that the odds don’t add up to 100
Also reading rumors that OU and TX might just say fuck you to the Big 12 and try do their own thing.
Also Red Dead Redemption is perennially underrated as a single player game
Also refs starting with all non calls. On James, on Iggy, then no flagrant. All of a sudden calling fouls on loose ball contact
Also related thing happened with he Islanders. Nassau voted down using tax dollars to upgrade the colosseum, Isles went to Barclays, but now they're making no money and I guess the ice sucks too, so Pokorov (sp?) is gonna nix their deal and they have no home after next year
Also remember that going to berkley not only ruins you chance at getting in the CC, but also the Ivy intelligentsia 
Also remember when he had the same ht/wt as Dak Prescott 
Also remember, "idiot" Emyr at 21 is still smarter than 95% of America 
Also remind me who james is again? Was he one of our roommates junior year?
Also revealed that he and his wife call each other “bro”
Also RIP all of our survivor picks
Also Roger Ailes is superdead 
Also said poke stops are probably going to be bought and sponsored, and also temporary events like Joe said 
Also Sam molloy kinda
Also SAS allegedly asking for 2 of Kuzma/Ingram/Hart, plus 2 first rounders for Kawhi
Also saved the Giants from becoming the Tampa Bay Giants (actually tho)
Also saw on Reddit: this is the first video game in history to actually see its player count spike during bad weather
Also saw this a while ago and it’s spot on lmao 
Also scientists need to invent male birth control that's not a condom ASAP. Seriously why hasn't it been done yet?
Also shout out to the bulls for not knowing the player roster rules and giving Jordan Bell to the Dubs for cash
Also shoutout to the smartest FH for going into business 
Also some gems from the legendary PFT Commenter yesterday 
Also some teams were experimenting with pitching a 1st inning reliever, essentially a “high” leverage situation where you can play R/L matchups against strong hitters, then bring in the “starter”
Also something like 30% of his targets have been uncatchable
Also sorry I’m advance for the person who gets me, because obviously I’ll know who it is
Also split second decision-making is one of the most important QB traits and it’s extremely difficult to evaluate
Also started naming my pokemons by move type 
Also surprised at Cormier at 3 since he seems to have no fans
Also surprisingly mediocre beer... like most people who’ve been to the US agreed the US wins and it’s not even a comparison 
Also talks a lot about how all this type of warfare is totally unprecedented and people only did what they did because they didn’t know any better. The early stages of the war especially were still fought under the impressions of heroic, romantic Napoleon style battles. Later on, it was more just do what your fellow soldiers do or die by execution for desertion
Also tbt/lol to the short lived clippers lob city bandwagon that got shredded every year by the warriors
Also Ted Cruz yesterday said marijuana legalization should be left to the states. Highly surprising in a good way, in my opinion.
Also that gif is unlocking, so I know I still have a shot
Also that last second FG made me realize the falcons lost partially due to that kneed ball reception which led to a FG. They lost by 5, would’ve been able to kick a FG for the win if down only 2. 
Also that no way Niners fire Harbaugh back in 2014
Also that number might not include non-HS teams
Also that roughing the passer call on Melvin Ingram was the most pussy call I've ever seen 
Also that was a great reference and if you didn't get it you should go watch The Shawshank Redemption right. The. Fuck. Now. 
Also that’s funny because today I was thinking about each of y’alls if you were out here, and becker you were my favorite 
Also the 2016? Diggs trade, aka the invention of auction dollar trading, which eventually destroyed the league
Also the article says it compared a Dynata survey of Wisconsin to counting masked people at the grocery store, and it was 45% vs 40%, so relatively accurate
Also the audiences are always terrible 
Also the Beatdown in Beantown is boxing not fighting. Major difference!
Also the best coaches scheme their offenses and defenses to make the best out of their personnel, which is really hard
Also the biggest dweeb in America gives exhibit #372954 on why hes going straight to the gulag 
Also the Cavs and Clippers and Cubs would easily be up except for the recent successes
Also the Cowboys  
Also the Dr LT Kelleher book 
Also the drama with his knee injuries
Also the dude never needed the attention while he had the spotlight for being a good player. He always liked the IG attention tho
Also the Eagles, part of the new racial justice woke NFL, have to decide if Desean Jackson’s about-as-racist-as-it-gets post allows them to cut his salary loose
Also the ending of the book is different
Also the ex-president of Yemen was killed today so that’s kinda big news 
Also the fact that Saudi is the chair of Human Rights 
Also the genocide was a group treatment
Also the grave dancing about how europe has handled it so much better than the US has quietly subsided
Also the intra-progressive catfighting about Pete Buttigieg being a “white male” vs “openly gay” is juicy 🍿 
Also the kickoff is not a 2025 kickoff
Also the luxury tax gets more severe every year you surpass the threshold, so lots of teams are trying to remain under the tax for just one year, ie this year 
Also the pack don't have a short passing game besides halfback flat routes. WRs all run 15 yd routes every time
Also the parking lot here is so classic. 2/3 vehicles are Ford F150s or Toyota tundras 
Also the picture that @Boe Jourque  posted is literally from Guangzhou, China. Gigantic yikes
Also the progressives have had very strong primary performances thus far, wonder how it will translate to the general elections.  2018 was poor for them, but I expect them to do better in 2020.
also the real life Rudy was a huge dick
Also the rona has given me a lot of golf time. Shot 38, 39, 40 in 3 consecutive 9s. Never been more prepared for the fuckhole open rematch @#JustFacts✅ 
Also the skills players would need would change. Like I feel like more of a focus on location consistency for pitchers, and low power hitters would be less in demand.
Also the steroid boxer guy Smitty went fucking off on how much he hates Pres after the fight right to his face (possibly while concussed). That was mildly entertaining 
Also the Taylor swift album is very good so far
Also the term “TERF” is hysterical
Also the UK’s decision to go 1 shot vs 2 may have been the smarter choice. Or at least not clearly worse
Also the WALL is apparently renovating existing fences, and Mexico doesn't appear to be paying for it.
Also the warriors are being suckered into playing ISO ball and their free flowing offense has stagnated if it settles in half court
Also the whole scholarship thing
Also their absolute conviction that Bernie was gonna energize the base, and total shock when it was a relatively normal turnout 
Also there was an Iranian militia OWA UAV attack on the US in Syria last night. Contractor KIA, 5x servicemen WIA
Also there was this publication (full article is too long, but exsum is good) about Chinas information warfare against the US 
Also there’s a special election for the PA-18 congressman today. Historically a super red district (think both don and mitt won by ~18) but recent polls have indicated a tossup.
Also there’s bound to be at least one person more athletic than me. There’s always several super athletes
also theyd have to work together to carry the heavy ass shotgun and ammo, but if they can carry around a 185 pound skiier/hiker/crossfitter from tree to tree then that should be no problem
Also third parties.
Also this 
Also this can’t help Miami entice a new HC who might be on the fence 
Also this is like totally normal, according to the article you linked
Also this is very bad by Fauci, who I’ve stanned for. Tough to “trust the science” when they pull this shit
Also this one
Also this Trevor Bauer stuff might actually be really bad
Also those gas mask bongs are totally overrated
Also TIL Best Actor Casey Affleck has a couple of sexual assault allegations that were settled out of court
Also TIL Daniel Bryan’s real name is Bryan Danielson lmaooooo
Also TIL Massachusetts used to include Maine and western NY... and Michigan... and Wisconsin 
Also TIL why marcus loves going out for brunch so much 
Also Tim Tebow got cut after hitting .056 In spring training and striking out 11 Times in 17 ABs
Also timely discussion last night. The 15th Obamacare co-op just announced its closing, this one in Oregon. There were 23 total, so just 8 remain. 
Also to Chan’s point, Kirk could’ve/should’ve been much cheaper with proper management
"Also today I’ve applied to:
Asgard
Field Pub
Brick and Mortar
Phoenix Landing 
Middle East
A4cade
Mad Monkfish
YMCA"
Also Tom Dodge! Pretty sure that's fake rapist!
Also tonight is my last night in Iraq  
Also TotF needs to get bricked up on defense
Also tough to distinguish from the simultaneous nationalization of CFB, where recruits don’t go to their local top college anymore like they used to
Also Travis Scott doing songs with Kanye and Cudi bringing us all back to 2010
Also Tristar apparently has zero good fighters nowadays
Also Trudeau has now had images of him in blackface from THREE separate occasions LMAOOOOO
Also Trump is whining like a baby on Twitter about losing Iowa to Cruz
Also trying to have a less retarded brother 
Also Tyreek Hill 🐐 
Also UCLA paid UNM $1.2MM for the matchup lmfao
Also unfortunately "cray" is a typo
Also unrelated but lol Jameis admitting to sexual assault
Also using Celsius the day after July 4 is basically communism
Also video shows the teenagers did walk away at first, and the native guy tainted them
Also Vikings D is bringing it
Also wanna quickly shout out Elon “Snake Oil” Musk for being a corona truther and also a little bitch about being wrong
Also want to add to Marcus point. The "soft power" favored by the democrats has basically evaporated under Obama (and this time it's 100% his fault). When you make promises and/or threats and don't follow through, your word becomes vapid.
Also want to point out that becker missed the one time gift of kamara keeper money which no longer exists this year 
Also was it just me or were commercials blah this year
Also way to give zero hearts on that fucking hysterical video I posted
Also way to round to 1 decimal while using 4 significant digits, you uneducated clown
Also we finally did some real PT today
Also we forgot about Draaaaaaake in the QB prospect conversation 
also well done Jeff this is how you make groupme lit instead of just saying groupme not lit
Also westchester golf works for me way better 
Also what are the odds Kap gets signed?
Also what are the odds shadeur goes to the giants, but in the 2nd…
Also what is defensive medicine?
Also what philistine uses a Green/Red scale where Green is the lowest
Also what's the postulate about "the more words you use, the more you're losing" again?
Also what's your role? MC, TC, Strategy?
Also when you can legit hit near 50% from 35 deep (and it's not just steph anymore) it opens up the floor even more
Also where the hell did these seeds come from. Doesn't seem very neutral to me
Also whoever this guy from barstool is:
Also why they hate the gigantic “no skill” centers
Also with Marcus not voting for Don (proud of you kid), is that 0-11 from this group?
Also worth mentioning that Amber Rose is Kanyes Ex, but also is now Wiz's wife and they have a kid together
Also worth noting that ~60% of all college students are women, which is quite an interesting gender gap in itself
Also would be perfect time to schedule the Beatdown in Beantown since you’ll probably never be in better shape
Also would like to point out the Giants (🐐) are one of 3 teams not to show
Also wouldn’t a major interest rate hike and low chance of winning be indistinguishable from a minor hike and high chance?
Also would've accepted Cocoa Puffs 
Also wrong groupme
Also wrong groupme
also wtf is "Mx. Gessen" is that like gender neutral?
Also y’all don’t look now but the Giants are 17-3 in last 20 and 2 games out of the wild card
Also you can't go no hands if you go Diglett. You have to use BOTH hands for the zipper and wriggle. You need only ONE hand for the unbutton, pulldown and hold. 
Also you could add me to the betting groupme since I actually get
Also you could become a millionaire selling coke outside the WM Open gates on Saturday afternoon
Also you get 10 minutes to eat a meal, cannot talk, and can only look straight ahead or straight down. Today at the volunteering I unconsciously ate lunch as fast as I could
"Also you have upvote gold on
R/justfuckmyshitup"
Also you just have to flex a muscle for like 30 seconds and it goes away. Like if you're sitting down just prop yourself up into a wall sit 
Also you left out Pumpkin vs New York
Also you never specified if it was balsamic vinegar or vinaigrette 
Also you tiao is like buttery ass breadsticks 
Also You’ll Be Back and cabinet battle #1
Also your power rankings are basically ordered by color haha
Also YUCK these bears jerseys 
"Also

Clinton 51.1
Sanders 48.4"
Also, [serious] if this is annoying and you want me to shut up, I will. Not sure if people are sick of my often whiny input on this political stuff
Also, 2018 GS starters vs East Conference all star starters, who’s better?
Also, 73% thought Sallie Mae was a person...
Also, 8 folds, 4 crumples, and a hybrid
Also, about time for the GOP Senate to quit the filibuster and put Merrick Garland on the bench 
Also, among Iowa Democrats under 30, Sanders beat Clinton 82%-18%
Also, are we meeting at patrons tn?
Also, assuming Chan will take over if Jamie is kicked
Also, assuming option exercise end date is day before the draft
Also, best diamond in the rough at BC?
Also, big yikes that it’s the SR-71, not 17
Also, check Tannehill’s quote on Covid testing. Forgot that I should be hating this guy
Also, completely missed it: there was a suicide bombing in Medina, Iraq yesterday, at the site of Mohammed's tomb, on the last day or Ramadan. Many anti-terror pundits are saying its stuff like this that needs to be publicized to turn Sunnis against ISIS. 
Also, Darrow make sure you fix the budget to $200
Also, do I apply for the earned income credit or whatever?
Also, does anybody here especially those still in school have access to free MS Office downloads? I would be most appreciative 
Also, don't look now but Mitt Romney was totally right about Russia being bad guys. (Obama was about as wrong as you can get, per usual.)
Also, Dwight Howard has no idea what the word "champion" means
Also, everyone is now required to have insurance. And if you don't, you're fined. So those who are healthy now have to pay for something they don't want. And in doing so, they help subsidize the high-risk patients
Also, false, those are my “hey these would look sweet at a BC tailgate” pants
Also, fuck you Barack Obama. You're the worst foreign policy president of all time. Today a Navy Seal was killed by the "JV team" in the war that you "ended". And you didn't even have the decency to thank him for his service. 
Also, fucking how?
Also, Go karting on Friday
Also, goodwin here's the vid on kickoffs I was referring to
Also, Goody and everyone else with debt, stop paying off your loans. Hilldog is gonna forgive it all when she's POTUS
Also, hilarious:
Also, his signature domestic achieve in Obamacare is obviously a massive failure (but just wait gaiz it will stabilize soon!)
Also, huge missed opportunity not calling it the McApp
Also, Huntur Hinry
Also, I am shopping Derrick Henry for 11 and Chris Hogan for 12. I am willing to deal for cheap 
Also, I assume since you said free market, you can buy any keeper for any price you want, as long as it's greater than or equal to the keeper price?
Also, I don't know how you don't pick hot female there. Like it's a no brainer for me
Also, I read an article recently on drug addiction that basically said "addicts" are usually not biologically addicted, only mentally. It's not like they cannot function without it, but it occupies all of their mind. 
Also, I sent you a text yesterday about driving up and you completely ignored it clearly
Also, I wanna go gokarting in south shore today. I think @Mr.StealYoGurl 2.0 and @Motorcycle Man expressed interest. Anybody else down?
Also, I will never get tired of the oversized suits in the early 2000s drafts
Also, id argue the recent best picture winners have been totally forgotten
Also, idk about Joe but i don't currently have a place to stay. Would appreciate a host if any of you want to. 
Also, if anybody knows anyone selling a ticket to the BC Miami game, I am buying 
Also, if Georgia beats Bama in the SEC championship, does a 2 loss bama make it
Also, if I’m the next villain in Capt America, I’m just gonna tell him he went to Cranbrook, that’s a private school, and he’s gonna sulk and walk away 
Also, if you photoshop that last chan DJ pic so the white guy is directly behind chan, it would be 100x better
Also, if you're this adamant about it, I would've preferred you bring it up in person when we discussed it instead of via groupme 2 days later
Also, ignore the troll
Also, is golf going to be involved in this trip? Maybe Sunday morning?
Also, is this taking place in Boston? I don't actually know where these courses are
Also, isn't counting cards not about math at all and actually just paying attention / keeping track 
Also, it didn’t make the news but ISIS conducted its biggest operation in 3 years last week, an attack on a prison in E Syria with 2 VBIEDs followed by an armed assault with hundreds of fighters. The fighting still isn’t over. 
Also, it feels wild that Avril isn’t the headliner
Also, it would be a great job for students applying to med school
Also, it’s an Arabic word so the English spelling is not exactly a standardized thing
Also, Jak and Daxter
Also, Josh Gordon 😳
Also, Kanye and Wiz rn...
Also, let me make it clear that this is a last resort, and I'm assuming you've extracted all Intel you can first. 
Also, literally always a tweet
Also, lmao Foles looking like a legend as a backup, then coming in as the starter and being as bad as Mitch 
Also, lol:
Also, looks like GOP will retain the senate
Also, looks like Trump/Gingrich 2016
Also, Love that you didn’t even consider that Jameson might actually like the Nats
Also, milk has sugar??
Also, more evidence for why I want everybody who works for the mainstream media to get hit by a truck:
Also, motion to institute new keeper rule: every year a keeper is kept, price raises $5. Goes into effect starting end of this year. And counts precious keeper years immediately.  
Also, neither of those groups actually know what they want policy-wise. It's all populism and demagoguery
Also, no takers for Colts finishing top 2 in AFC South?
Also, one of the key revelations over the past 3-4 years is: the idea that the Arab Muslim world cares about itself as a unified people is wrong. This was a key assumption of the Obama administration, and one that I probably would’ve agreed with. But as Israel has further settled into Palestinian territory, Arab Gulf nations have made historic diplomatic accords with Israel. 
Also, Planned parenthood doesn't use federal funding to pay for abortions
Also, Rubio 🐩
Also, sandwich test 
Also, since Olivia🐐 came through in the clutch, are we still doing that?
Also, somebody has to scroll to his Facebook and find The Post. I know it's Oct / Nov 2012
Also, something I never realized until this photo:
Also, srs question, what are we doing for the draft?
Also, the biology line sticks out to me the most 
Also, the Minnesota miracle is absolutely one of the craziest moments I’ve ever seen in sports. 
Also, the more I watch the warriors these playoffs, the more I'm convinced Westbrook really was the problem on OKC
Also, this is exactly the type of media behavior that fuels the “fake news” narrative 
Also, to goodys point, anybody who is able bodied and not a criminal can join the army and get healthcare for life
Also, top gun 2 was awesome and everybody should see it
Also, tough not to put LOTR, Star Wars and Indiana Jones in the conversation. I absolutely loved those movies as a kid
"Also, Trump appointed Omarosa from
The apprentice as his Director of African American Outreach. Can't make this stuff up"
Also, Trumps son and wife didn't register to vote in time for the primary 😂😂😂
Also, TUF1 finale was the first event to be live broadcast completely on cable, so there's that haha
Also, two of Jesus' last words were "Eli! Eli!" So yeah Jesus clearly votes for Eli too
Also, very strong evidence that Wikileaks has ties with the Russian govt
Also, way to push the trump-skeptical republicans further toward Biden 
Also, what the fuck Cam
Also, when are we boxing?
Also, when you choose your starter, if you walk away from the 3 options 5 times, Pikachu appears
Also, Wins = everything. But also the eye test is king in case a good player is on a bad team. 
Also, you pick Biden because Bernie is a self described socialist
Also: https://paramore-heardle.glitch.me/
Also: latest electoral projection from UVA Center for Politics
Also^
Alt O C A is the most useful shortcut ever
Alternatively I will be in the Boston area on July 16 weekend 
Although I do admit when I'm launching missiles at Syria, I do enjoy a nice slice of chocolate cake
Although if a republican wins, there will be hilarious protests and NYU students with PTSD so that might be entertaining
Although I'm probably the bottom of the power rankings in attire so idk what the hell shes talking about there. Maybe she was thinking of Trevor because he was there too
Although it would in effect be a travel ban on Muslim countries, so maybe trump should endorse it
Although it's funny that Paul Ryan basically said "HRC will not work with our agenda. Trump is stupid and unprincipled enough to be convinced"
Although lemon peppering got us the PKs (date TBD) so it’s a good thing sometimes
Although pre snap motion by the offense does help a lot, which I suppose is why they do it lol
Although that certainly doesn’t prevent it from tracking you
Although that Tuck ‘22 has a ton of cred…
Although the rumor was first reported by a Redditor named KatyPerrysBootyHole, so at least there's that
Although today was admittedly a weak matchup 
Alumni must be ELECTRIC rn
Always build more housing
Always can count on western mass for men of culture 
Always great to see the Aryans come out on top
Always knew you liked dragons
Always liked politics. When I was in high school I went to a politics summer camp at Gtown that kicked it into a gear, then the 2012 election helped as well. Stuff I read mostly comes from pundits I follow on Twitter and articles they share. Recently I've been a huge fan of Commentary and Reason (both libertarian), Red State (conservative), and Washington Post (everything). 
Always love fans hating players on their own teams and then saying “it takes a certain type to handle it here” when they leave
Always love to hear how two pals became such great friends
Always room aboard the Ners train
Always room for more fans on the Ners train
Always thinking about dragons 
Always thought I was more of a James Holzhauer guy but enough people think Mullens that I’ve accepted it 
Always thought of Marcus as more of a POV guy and less of a dorm orgy guy but the proof is in the emails 
Am genuinely curious who @The Awbarn Bandwagoner is supporting though
Am I insane or are y’all off by a generation 
Am I missing anything
Am I missing anything?
Am I missing something here?
Am I really the only one who has romanced a lady of the night?
Am I retarded or did you just call it “must see”
Am I the most net positive gambler in the FH?
Am I the only one who thinks Drew Lock is absolute garbage?
Amalfi coast is a Classico honeymoon spot
Amanda Nunes has an argument but WMMA is a different list IMO
Amanda Nunez just KTFO Cris Cyborg in 51 seconds 
Amare?
Amari at $20 AAV is a deal after this offseason
Amari cooper cowboys
Amari for a 5th lol
Amazing
Amazing amazing play
Amazing celebration tribute 
Amazing line I just overheard. Girl is telling some story, I walk by and and she finishes up, and some guy responds “wait so is this a me too thing or an I was into it thing? ”
Amazing offensive play calling by Shanahan, Jimmy G best game of his career(?), awesome individual performances by the whole offense
amazing play calling
Amazing series
Amazing shot
Amazing two plays by the Ners
Amazing weeks 1 and 2. So entertained 
Amazing write up goody
Amazing. Hillary lost the women vote to Sanders by 7 points.
Amazingly I only gained 1 pound on vacation. Just weighed in at 161
Amazon moving to Detroit would be a huge net positive for Detroit. It would be a huge net positive anywhere
Amen Corner on Easter Sunday 🙏🏼 
Amendola injured as soon as he becomes a pivotal target. Deja déjà déjà déjà vu.
America is too fat lazy and poor
America was actually founded in 1619, when slaves first arrived in the colonies, not 1776. Everything in America for all time has been based on slavery.
American -10000000
American Cennel Klub?
American Chop Suey is the most absurd thing I’ve ever heard
Americans didn’t even blow it, just rahm and Hovland went bananas
AmEx isn't a bank, scrub
Among Europes biggest problems are their rate of youth NEETs (non employed, in education, in training); basically expected to be lifelong welfare queens. There's a direct correlation between a country's rates of NEETs and economic health. 
Among my most drafted RBs so far are Michael Carter, Braelon Allen, and Isaiah Davis. The draft was not good to the portfolio
Amongst NFL fans?? No way lol
Amongst other things
Amongst other things, but mainly that. For example we had to build healthcare.gov after the original contractor fucked up
Amongst other things, yes
Amygdala!
An ability to filter for certain commenters, key words, time windows, etc. Add it to the BRD. 
An adjacent team I work with every day is highly focused on this exact stuff so it’s kind of a hot topic for me
An Alex Smith 40 yard bootleg would be the greatest play in NFL history
An experiment we’re seeing play out now with LIV 
An F-16
An ice bar with a hot tub inside of it
An international superstar? Aww thanks eemmzz
An officer shooting a guy in the back 7 times at point blank range is like a golfer missing a 3 foot putt
An old classic article about the HR derby being awesome 
An old onion article
An underrated part of the round was Joe hitting 4/5 greens on the par 3s
Anacostia is probably best bang for your buck. Right on the green line
Analyst, Sr analyst, consultant, mgr, sr mgr, MD
Analysts were questioning his separation ability, especially stopping or turning quickly
"Analysts: “here are the consensus top 3 picks”
Browns: Lol fuck that"
Analytics are BULLSHIT! YOUR EYEBALLS TELL THE STORY
And #5 could be important too, that LM can change number of IR slots week by week
And $50 on browns +190
And (again nitpicking) Mighty Mouse is similar in that the guys he beat weren’t close to the guys cejudo beat
And @#TriviaChamp☝️ same question
And @Jeff Savarino, every change I suggest should be a rule. I am eternally wyze
And @Skimmer 
And @The Big Dick Bandit absolutely legendary
and @👀 
And “Marcus - Big Man Little Dignity” is too low hanging of a fruit, even for me
And “otherwise we would look really stupid” would be so fucking funny
And “the fix is in”
And 538 of course ;)
And 70% is the ceiling. It doesn’t get higher than that for reasons I don’t understand 
And a big fruity pebbles guy
And a black and white shake
And a blue hair girl chose to get married there 🤔 
And a cat
And a counter narrative appears!!!
And a dowry that probably includes 20 servants
And a headcase. But guess the saints saw potential. I don’t blame them
And a lemon soufflé 
And a lot of cash
And a lot of Lil Wayne actually
And a Pats loss tomorrow (assuming fat mac starts)
And Aaron Rodgers didn’t play bad. If the packers win that game nobody is saying he did. He definitely sucked the last drive so it’s easy pickings for haters. But a lot of those bad throws were to rookies and the timing was off. So no not an MVP performance but still a damn good one
And actually can we have it at my place? I wanna hang out with you guys alongside my girlfriend who I'm spending the entire day after with
And actually Joe, maybe if we were WORSE then goody wouldn't have rage quit and we could've prevented this 
And Alex Ali
And all the non-combatant officers (lawyers, doctors, nurses) go home next week so hopefully we get to drop all the fatties and whiners 
And all the senior people have jumped between companies 2 or 3 times anyway just chasing the next promotion and have zero actual belief in the company culture or whatever
And all they're doing is giving evidence to their detractors that they really are the biased hacks they're accused of being
And all this comes at a time when teams are actively trying to leave the ACC
And also “what the private sector does can provide us lots of intel on what foreign countries are doing”. Might be too much of an intel lens on my interpretation but that’s how I see it
And also fall 2012
And also I largely agree with that stance haha
And also I think there’s a minimum income threshold where you don’t have to file 
And also I’m gonna buy a ticket to that chvrches concert. Last call if anyone wants to not let me go alone
And also I'm skeptical of preventative care because people don't take care of themselves. See: obesity
And also increase residency spaces
And also let’s not all forget our stances here when the next NFL player is arrested for DV and we all call for his head
And also machado is a generational scumbag. Clowney appears to be a good guy that you don’t like for some reason
And also mandatory reminder that your team was ass until DeAngelo
And also northeastern at 39
And also only working for like 6 months
and also remember it's an 8 team league, 1 additional FLEX slot, and keeper prices will inflate by $5 every subsequent year (starting end of this year)
And also results are transmit via smartphone like in the picture 
And also since anybody who doesn’t vote is gay, and LGBT numbers are through the roof, it might be a red wave
And also that he is a joke to the NBA just like Iggy is a joke to music, so we aren't surprised that their relationship is also a joke 
And also the assumption that any <30 non-voter or warren voter would automatically be a Bernie voter
And also the twins are involved and getting maeda for pitcher brusdar graterol, the #30 prospect
And also this is much more of a partnership than you might imagine. Like the top people at Accenture work very closely with the top people at BofA to determine what needs to be done from a high level. If all goes well, the partnership continues down to the actual workers, like me. 
And also TIL in FIBA, it's not a rule and you can tip slam any thing that hits the rim
And also with all the trading up for a QB in the recent drafts, waiting for 4 is far from a guarantee
And also, what’s the verdict on offseason swap backs
And also, you can pick up players depending on the time the waiver clears
And amari Cooper $100/20 damn
And amazingly they’ve done it in back to back seasons
and American Hero JJ Watt of course
And amidst all the despair stands Andrew Becker, bastion of the little bit of good that remains. Pretty representative of society as a whole
And an undertaker, because he’s burying you right now
And another
And another tidbit ( @Boe Jourque will like this one), there is an oil and gas bill in Colorado Prop 112 that is opposed by the energy industry, who has spent $31MM against it compared to $1.6MM for it. Nevertheless, it is currently slightly favored to pass
And anybody who is able to go to any non community college as a full time student is also super privileged, relative to the whole
And apparently he's also trying to blame is PEDs on a dick pill
And apparently Kyrie didn't count for shit before Lebron returned
And Arby’s commercials 
And are we gonna do something fun for it?
And aren't there only like 12 teams in the whole EPL?
And Arian Foster 
And as I mentioned last night, if you're anti Putin in a former USSR NATO country, you might literally be assassinated
And as you all know, foreign policy > domestic policy x1000 in my view
And Asian chicks love you
And at my poopy white collar job I was basically always the youngest one 
And at the end of the day, having parents who care about your education is THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR in a students success
And at the end of the day, people vote not corporations 
And at zero point did I say "I hate how much I love this!" Or anything remotely resembling that so you can fuck off too
And bang Asian hookers 
"And barring anything crazy, the AJ 🏈 AJ ensures my victory over Dictator Goodwin in the 24B league:
"
And be able to regularly hit 190 yard par 3 greens
And beanpot senior year
And Bear Necessities 
And because we traded 3 first rounders to move up this draft and have nothing left to trade
And becker 
And Becker dumped on Marcus a lot already but it’s actually embarrassing he didn’t make the playoffs considering his keepers
And Becker got him
And Becker it's actually Mielvin Gurdun
And Becker no I actually mute most people who get me upset. But when I talked yesterday about the impending progressive pivot against latinos, and 1619 Lady posts that in <24 hours, it's just so so juicy
And Becker this isn't a question of who's getting care, it's who's paying for it
And Becker, October I think, right before the election
And being confident in NATO backing vs being totally unsure could drastically change their behavior to a Russian intervention, hard or soft
And bengals at +190
And Bill still manages to out-awkward everybody, which is an incredible feat
And BOB traded Clowney for peanuts last year too
And Bobi
And Bobs Burgers episode that was alluded to this morning
And Boogie and the Brow are gonna run a heavyweight high pick and roll that will steamroll the NBA!
And boom - bob menendez, corrupt NJ democratic senator is re-elected
And boom, it worked again �
And Bortles
And boxing
And Brodie only registered 2.4 WAR this year while earning $38 million
And btw Dook we have a prod release today, so as long as that goes smoothly I have little to do
And btw Jeff the wall punch didn't cost me money, it in fact made my friend money. So if history repeats itself...
And btw the $3M team last year drafted in June while ADPs were still super exploitable
And by “paid lodging” I mean becker can I crash on your couch
And by no collusion, I mean the owner is making a move in their best interests and only their best interests.
And calling things “hella gay”
And can I get a ride?
And Chan
And Charles Barkley is a moron
And check this horseshit. The bomber sued his local police in 2011 for being racist against Muslims... Unfuckingbelivable
And chill with the “do ur own research” opinions
And chuck knoblauch
And CLEVELAND 
And Cole Younger fucking sucks
And Collin +1600
And communication by the other DB
And correct, not a single pentagon official is in agreement with the move. In fact the top military generals appear to not even have been briefed
And count votes 7-5 in a 10 team league
And cowboys of course
and crustaceans are not fucking meat
And Danielle?
and Darnold could be moved if the Jets draft fields and get an offer they like
And darrow
And darrow 
and Darrow you've been hearting messages so wtf man
And DeJordan LaKelleher was an all pro rookie and SB champion
And Ders under 7.5 (even money?)
and did a bunch of computer science but no degree
And did nothing but work hard to deserve it
And did you not see kids who never struck out?
And diet policy
And Diggs has zero value apparently 
And dodgers of course of course
And Don yelled at Steph Curry
And don’t forget about special teams baby!!
And don’t forget because they’re good. 
And don’t forget that oriental is still considered a racist term because it lumps all north East Asians into a single category 
And drinking 24 beers straight is a Gogerian feat
And dudes who can drive 
And Eduardo Nunez from a few days ago
and emyr kept Luck!
And Emyr...
And equipment
And especially when you post “PERSPECTIVE” on your IG 
And even if he was a good bizman, your rationale is still as I articulated, correct?
And even if they do that, it’s an extremely difficult rebuild considering what they gave
And even if you could in 2 years, we all know it's a farce
And even if you do, it’s even more difficult to have it carry over next season. Remember the Jags?
and Everett warned him like 3 times
And everybody has popped out so if you happen to pop out foul then whatever
And everybody knew it too before they handed him the keys to the franchise 
And Florida has awful fans, which makes sense with their awful people
And for categories, you can either choose to win 1-0 based on who won more categories, or take a weekly wins-losses count based on how many categories you win in a week. Like you can win 9-0 or 5-4 in a week
And foreign policy is captured not at all in these things 
And fuck AJ Black
And fuck it give me Texans under 4.5 even money 
And fuck Jon Jones forever
And fundraising numbers massively favor the Democrats - $951MM vs $637MM in the house; $513 vs $361 in the senate. 
And funnily, the yay vote would almost surely win a roll call anyway, but the fact the RNC is strong arming it through anyway is a really really bad look
And gave Jon Gruden $100 million 
And given the Braves, Falcons, and Bulldogs, it’s more than fitting if Trump blows an 85% lead in Georgia
And glorious Bernie got the little bird. Nature shows who’s good and who’s evil.  
And good job everybody not picking Duke
And goody is correct. So only 1 left
and goody ridicules you if you're too high or too low
And goody you know vale tudo was popular in Brazil throughout the century, not sure exactly of the years 
And got a team friendly deal by truly having the whole team minus a QB. Just great timing, probably unplanned
And gotta be something about if the light is the same state as when you left it...
And Great win BC 
And had a ton of success as an NFL assistant. Carroll failed hard in his first NFL attempt
And have the taxpayer pay for it
And have to assume we're gonna lose one of the cakewalks, like we do every year haha
And he acted a fool in that hearing with the DHS
And he also says the quality gap between 3-4 stars is much bigger than 4-5 stars
And he claimed he would've stopped 9/11 if he was on the plane
And he doesn’t play until Tuesday so it’s as if you could’ve done this yourself 
And he donated $10MM to his hometown county public school system 2 weeks ago
And he has a skill set Brady and Rodgers don't
And he hasn't actually made the decree yet but is publicly planning to. So basically same thing
And he hates Jews 
And he might fuck around and do both
And he opens this ask.fm page (ask me a question anonymously), and oh lord it takes a life of its own. He makes more and more baseless claims, starts calling himself an international celebrity, says he's a singer / dancer / NFL combine ready / producer / etc. The hate on the ask.fm page is pouring in, and he tries to brush it off though it's clearly getting under his skin
And he preemptively boasted about the attendance so he asked for it
And he proves it over and over and over
And he says Ossoff/Perdue is not a lock yet but the signs of a Perdue win are not showing
And he was garbage as a rookie
And he wore a brown suit with a yellow shirt or vest, and he looked like Winnie the Pooh 
And he’s a whiny bitch
And he’s cheap as hell which is unprecedented 
And he’s significantly better than he’s given credit for! so far at least
And he’s the favorite in WI and MI, even if you consider the other 3 toss ups
And here is the index efficiency score top 3
And here’s the song cover art
And he's brought up the HS baseball thing multiple times in interviews, so he's clearly very proud of that. It's probably his greatest achievement in life
And he's white, I forgot
And Hillary has declared she wants to forgive them as much as possible. Poof. Sorry everybody who was responsible and paid off your loans, thank you for subsidizing your less-capable peers. No you don't get a credit. 
And his favorite coach is Jim Baeheim
And his overripe pear body 
And Hoops dated Shaq lmfao
And hopefully also because it was funny
And how he dribbles down the court
And I actually agree with them. I think people around the world care so much about their teams, that their lives are truly better because of them. And I think it's a LOT of people. Aggregate Utility, if you will John. 
And I added one I forgot, how unfair Nordstrom is being to ivanka 
And I admit all of my statements on this are with a Rubio bias, but I don't think it's ungrounded
And I already said I never used in my application 
And I am for essentially ignoring those who have already given up
And I am HOWLING
And I am not accounting for marketability or ethics
And I bet tankie boy isn’t either
And I bleed red white and blue baby
And I can hit becker with the bat if he loses me money
And I can’t believe the kids who violently assaulted Nick just completely got away with it
And I can’t believe they don’t use a 19/30 Easton black magic either
And I can’t keep turning up uninvited at the Bauer household. Shelbie told me last time that her patience was getting thin
And I could always tell when he got home because he would blast Mo Bamba in his car and I could hear it from inside 
And I could probably take the subway to Astoria and get a bagel there before I get one at Thompson's Square 3 streets away
And i counted Arlington close enough to Dallas, so it's not that 
And I don’t just mean the Ners running game
And I don’t think there’s a better way to me to introduce myself to Frankie than to smoke him in a HR derby
And I don't feel as strongly as you do about FFL mirroring real football, since I'd rather have positional balance
And I don't know the ins and outs of the spying programs but I'm pretty sure it's not a room of people flipping through the phone book and picking a random person to snoop on
And I frequently get a dim screen where the phone freezes 
And I guess that makes Goodell a Sith Lord, which also totally makes sense 
And I guess the 90s/00s Yankees too haha
And I have never met Nan, but that bitch made the Joe Bourque Hate List, which is an extremely exclusive group. So I’d be remiss if I didn’t hate her to
And I have someone who gave 10:1 odds 
And I just cant get behind leaving the entire south to the cowboys or redskins. 
And I just think both parties are equally amoral and both equally prioritize their power over everything else
And I know it is for you too Goodwin 
And I know you two don’t care because he’s a conservative, but I worry about what Norms this sets going forward
And I know you're asking "what does 1 Trevor mean", well... "Lift up the sack with left hand wipe with the right.. Then I don't touch anything with my arm or wrist as you do if you lean"
And I largely enjoyed S1
And I learned he went abroad to Madrid with connor and everyone there thought he was a weirdo too
And i looove fitness
And I love America more than both
And I love that that can be considered a slant
And I missed birdie putts on 17 and 18, 17 was within 15 feet too
And I never pulled the trigger because i couldn’t swallow the pill  
And I played Destiny a lot in 2015 but haven't played in months now 
And I remember being like 8 years old and seeing Cooler Ranch and thinking “this doesn’t make sense, what is it Cooler than?”
And I resoundingly won the nut busting debate
And I said I bet colts finish top 2 in AFC south and nobody took
And I said I couldn’t go because I’m flying out early. But I’m now not flying out until 4
And I say this as someone who drafted a LOT of him in the 4/5th round 
And I sorta think most blondes are overrated to begin with
And I think base stats cap at lvl 20
And I think Emyr and Kevin are out at 6-7, since Jaime is 7-6 and has a significant points lead
And I think I had around like 9% body fat at the time. Now I’m like 160 with 15% lol
And I think they’re raging alcoholics independent of, not because, they’re Mets fans. But I’m not 100% sure. 
And I thought the Asian chick was a terrible actress and character 
And I was also right than Kenyan Drake was trash
And I was doing bench 5x5 at 165 before. I struggled to do 5x5 at 155 today
And I was wrong about NBA. Apparently national media revenue is much higher than I thought 
And I would also be interested in seeing Johns proposition too hahaha
And I wouldn’t have it any other way
And I’ll round it out with a classic: the stable genius
And I’m 2 hours behind, not 3. Know you’re friends. 
And I’m finna hop on the succession train
And I’m good at clash Royale 
And I’m retarded
And if any of you wouldn't you're pieces of shit
And if he was made to take a lie detector test, what are the odds "Do you want your daughter Ivanka to piss on your face?" falls into the "yes" category
And if I beat you straight up again you have to box Chan 
And if I do fight them, how do I go about doing that?
And if I'm invited to the goodwin black Easter celebration
And if it was freshman fingering productivity, Marcus would be Jake Plummer 
And if it's a first, you get a goal line time out 
and if Monahan wants to keep his job he has to convince the players of that
And if the comment was about Bruce, you must let loose
And if the government spies on you and finds out that you're running a massive cocaine operation, there's nothing they can do.
And if we go by draft-trumps-waiver, that adds another twist if waiver > draft value
And if you disagree he calls you an imperialist
And if you're gonna say AP you gotta say Jamaal Charles
And if you're in EV you should stop into McSorleys for 2 beers
And Iggy found out about it on Twitter 
And I'm also saying this all as a neutral party. Because I'm a bulls fan now, or something
And I'm going nuts over David Johnson's nuts
And I'm sorry for eating your fruity pebbles
And I'm still not sure if that's because people like Bernie or hate Hillary
And in Carhardt commercials
And in case you didn’t know all the missiles, training, etc is provided by Iran
And in parallel, would you support the moderate candidate if you thought they had a better chance of beating trump, compared to a progressive candidate who has a weaker chance?
And include the likes of Slobster and Killamari 
And Indian food has “chicken 65” (yes that’s what it’s called) and Indian people love it
And Indiana Jones 4
And instead, on the heels of trying to force Hillary who everyone hates, they tried to force Kamala who everyone hates
And ironically closing schools is incredibly unpopular so it actually will probably help them electorally
And ironically in a totally free market, patents don't exist so the classic supply and demand model would drive down prices a lot a lot. Of course that's not the reality, but just saying
And ironically the whole fiasco was about the lack of black actors 😂
And ironically, the performer TD Rice added some anti-slavery verses to the song in 1832 (original was written in 1830)
And is "replacement level" counting as all RBs who play? Because that affects the denominator a lot.
and is Trevor Bauer lite 
And isn't that what this thread as been about with addazio?
And it also presents a lot of good data on why conventional metrics (like points and rebounds) are often bullshit
And it goes without saying but PG didn’t make it out of round 1 
And it makes you need chipotlaway
And it only had one team now so it might've even lost that title
And it seems like I am higher on the Broncos guys than you are. I think Jeudy is a stud and Sutton was really good 2 years ago
And it was an “only if kept” clause
And it’s a serious problem for the left that the uber progressives would rather split out than support the moderate left. Refusal to support anybody but the extreme left leads to party fracturing and weak candidates 
And it’s also because I do in fact hit dingers 
And it’s for charity. So anybody who doesn’t want to participate hates charity
And it’s possible you can change the intent. It worked in Japan for the Allies
And it’s so true
And it’s spelled it wrong!!
and italian men from italy are just 5'7 rude pervy fats
And it's a BS rule so that should be a fumburu
And it's also totally possible somebody else did make an offer
And it's funny because in the Quran itself, all it says is that women should dress modestly. It's these Hadiths that were written way later that are interpreted as "must literally cover your entire body"
And it's more like 10 times
And it's not like they didn't like him for being a jerk or anything, it was because he was lazy and apathetic.
And it's not the system that's choosing the doctor, it's the individual. If they want to choose expensive insurance, go right ahead
And it's pretty ironic that the Party of Fiscal Responsibility rushed it through the house before the CBO published a review  
And Jamie is the other Bash Bro
And JColes False Prophets is getting a ton of “oh damn so that’s what he meant” 
And Jeff at least the above two had the conviction to own their position, be it the wrong one. Instead you went out of your way unsolicited to say you weren’t rooting for BC to lose, only to pull a disgusting 180 when you learned you might not be alone in your awful opinion. 
And Jeff knows ball
And Jeff with a signature non-answer 
And Jeff you're correct. Jason Hanson
And Jim Khakis lost last night. And the Giants have lost 4 straight and are 6.5 back and essentially out of the playoffs. And the warriors are... Well their still reigning champs so at least o have that 
And Jimmy Hoffa Jr in the Irishman 
And Joe I was referring more to the 4 consecutive seasons feat
And Joe is up on you 55, which will also lessen. 
And joe with the giants 
And John is grand ayatollah khamineni
and John vs. Kevin
And just like that. 
And Justin Jefferson. And Justin Herbert 
And kamara and Thomas of course 
And Kentucky/Indiana looks off to me but not totally sure 
And Kevin I actually think 2 parties is the best option 
And Khomeini is on his deathbed
And kill themseves 
And Klay come on man that was unbelievably airheaded “defense”
And Kristen of course 
And Kyle Allen is trash
And Landry put on an MVP dodgeball performance 
And last series the narrative were that the Celtics were a playoff team and Kyrie goes into overdrive. Now they face the Bucks who are amazing and the whole thing is flipped upside down
And lastly getting value out of a QB has been proven to not be a good strategy. Or rather getting a good QB is super important, regardless of cost
And lemme get poirier by finish $25 +140
And Lenny over 25.5 receiving  
And locations?
And lol 3rd party voters again
And longest of the 4?
And lose you money
And losing David Johnson hurt...
And lots of right wingers are saying "I don't support abortion at all, and it's worse that you're making me pay for it"
And low key eovaldi 
And made a music video that would make Russell Wilson cringe
And magic Johnson 
And make sure you don't pizza when you're supposed to French fry
And manchin wins in WV. The democrat who voted for kavanaugh 
And maybe demonizing the opposing party isn’t a good strategy 🤔 
And Maz allegedly knew the girl and kept saying how great of a person she was and mental health and there’s lots of discrimination at BC etc etc. and i kept going back to the main fact
And methhead gay polygamist tiger king Joe Exotic is somehow still the most like-able character 
And mmmBellarmine
And Monahan had to assume he would survive this. He doesn’t seem like a guy who would willingly risk losing his job to save the tour
And Moodys downgraded Israel’s credit rating by TWO (2) grades, for all the finance bros 
And more good news is I’ve lost 7 pounds in ~2 weeks so I’m back in the appropriate weight class
And most of Kanyes rant was about Amber Rose. He said Wiz got trapped by a stripper and that he owns Wiz's kid and a bunch of other stuff. And basically the Internet looked at Kanye being married to Kim K and rolled it's eyes...
And Muellers letter to Barr specifically addresses this point: the findings are extremely serious, and Barr’s summary memo was dishonest in representing that.
And my personal opinion is that he’s somewhere in between, but that his years with the Cs were more of an anomaly than his years with the Kings
And my statement doesn't apply to all situations, only terrorists
And my table will be Marcus’ circular table
And my trek was v fun af amazeballs 
And napoleon dynamite was the funniest movie of all time
And no an oil change isn’t a move any more than tickling is
And no he is not a doctor
And no I am extremely confident in this one lol didn’t you watch the video 
And nobody can define what CRT is lol. It’s like a blanket term for everything that talks about race, no matter how salient or bogus 
And none of those have used sarin or chlorine gas so far
And none of you jamokes watched that video
And not even “Hey my trip was amazing, but got majorly inconvenienced at the end”. But “here’s a fucking novel about my problems, give me all the attention and pity”
And not sure if technically "corrupt", but he invaded Ukraine and completely denied it as it was going on
And now arya fuxin Stark is in Audi ads this is horseshit
And now he's gonna be locked up for a lot more. Not great decision making 
And now the TBoJ must come for the handlers of Peng Shuai 
And now we beat number one seeds. Full circle
And now we FaceTime and do joint drafts weekly
And OBJ loves it all
And of course can’t forget Russia already invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 214
And of course learning about Trevor “Shitdick” Doherty 
And on the other hand, that seemingly insignificant leap second last year actually fucked up some serious shit in systems around the world
And once again, Bernie has the opportunity to be nuanced with his stance but he chooses not to
And one of the alleged leaked games was the 0-0 at end of regulation game vs VTech hahahaha
And only 50% Parsons too
And other plans on the market will?
And Pablo
And pass by Foles
And Pats fans still whine about being disliked and unfairly treated
And PED using, domestic abusing, multiple DUI-ing, hitting-and-running, illegal firearm carrying cokehead
And people HATE Kevin Durant so it gets the blood boiling to a fun point 
And people have to actually follow the advice!  Which they won't!!
And personal update, I did not get expert marksman with the M9 :(
And PETA is a false flag by Big Meat
And Peyton to mahomes is not gonna happen
And playing Bob the Builder vs Monster Truck
And porn
And pro shop
And probably Kent bazemore. I actually know nothing about him but his bum ass keeps finding his way onto a roster so players must love him
And ratchet and clank, but I liked the jak ones better
And Reddit loooves it some comeuppance
And Reggie Bush? for CFB
And remember it’s not finish the term, not impeachment conviction 
And remember, the company doesn’t give a shit about you except how much money you can make them
And replacing your college friends with newer shinier ones
And RIP Stephen Hawking
And SA-3s with no radars 
And same movie, Marcus can be the guidance counselor who constantly tells his counselees about his intramural feats 
And Scheffler missed back to back men from the boys on 16 and 17, and lost by 1
And Seattle to win NFCw for $25
And several to be named NFL players!!
And sexual favors
And she asked today why I always pull out, and I said not pulling out is just not right without explicit permission, and she said no it’s not. And I said no you watch I bet every man will agree with me
And she just sounds so weak when attacking him. He is way better at attacking  
And she’s a weirdo herself so it means something 
And simplify the god damn tax code
And since those guys were big enough to get good sponsor money, they probably got screwed most by the Reebok deal
And Singapore would be a better analogy
AND single man coverage
And smh on you Emz and Jeff for voting Bernie. Have you already forgotten the "Change!" false promises of 8 years ago?
And Snoo Snoo signs with the Ners
And sorry to John, Nick, and other football haters aka communists
and specificity of 98.5%
And StarCraft 2
And Steve young 
And still LOL that the broncos passed on Fields 
And straka
And Superdry appears to the the most popular clothing brand
And Swaggy hahaha
And tbh, other than Bannon and Priebus and Flynn and sorta Sessions, I'm cool with most of his cabinet picks so far. And if Romney gets SecState that would be nice
And Teddy B to take first snap for Den $25 +140
And Teddy is super ironic hahaha. That dude hates peace 
And that aerodactyl would be an ideal FS
And that he and Ricky both went to OSU, and he idolized Ricky for a long time
And that his family and extended family all are pro baseball players
And that laziness is amplified tenfold with a little marijuana
and that would be when the US would probably get involved, when Israel and Iran start trading blows
And that’s him sounding his best lol
And that’s why you celebrated alongside him when he broke 90
And that's because people aren't insured right? Or their insurance doesn't pay the whole thing, and there's fights between the hospital and the insurance company 
And that's not even mentioning that the entire shitshow came at the cost of a ~10% increase in premiums for ACA plans
And the 2055 fund is probably ~60% SP500 anyway
And the 6 foot putts
And the 96-2001 Yankees team might’ve been the best team ever
And the alternative is trump. Like ayfkm? 
And the bet was supposed to be lunch but I think we decided $20 instead or something
And the Biden “campaign” is blaming the Bernie campaign for it
And the biggest deep threat runs a 4.27
And the blondes auto plus 2 thing is like exactly why I think blondes are overrated
And the bottom of the latrine looks like joe
And the broons 
And the brown fever is an added bonus i suppose
And the cherry on top: who’s #2 in EPA? The Steak Man himself, Mr. Dimes
And the Comp Sci line
And the contradictions lol. "I'm an open book, everybody knows everything about me". "So a lot of you don't know that I've been singing and dancing professionally my whole life"
And the couped president is a Nobel peace prize winner, which aged extremely poorly, unrelated to the coup 
And the COVID shot virtue signaling smh
And the crazy thing is that the US already has a system where anybody who is not a felon can get free healthcare and free college. It's called the US military
And the Cs did something similar with Stevens, correct?
And the dude had the nerve to write an article about said account LMAO
And the fact that nobody has called it out 
And the fucking show will be done by then
And the game lags like crazy
And the giant highlight-less over saturated numbers 
And the Giants just released Back 2 Back 2 Back today in the form of home runs 
And the girl from the Clemson trip 
And the GOP held onto the Senate in Indiana, which is kind of a big upset. The Dem was polling ahead for months, shifted past 2 weeks
And the government has a cure for cancer and aids, they just don't release it to keep down the black population 
And the Hooves
and the icing on the cake: she just got deported for overstaying her visa lmao
And the island that was the original Rhode Island was initially called Aquidneck Island
And the Kangaroo was Jackie Legs
And the key ingredient: ridiculous levels of overhype 
And the mat was like a bunch of wall pads just thrown on the floor
And the most vocal opposition to the trade was Goodwin, who wasn’t even in the league, having quit for aforementioned reasons. 
And the name "canola" comes from Canada + Oil/Oleum, chosen by the Rapeseed Assc of Canada
And the no holding call on the pick 
And the NT wasn’t even rushing the QB! 
And the number of floors between each attempt remains constant
And the people they hate the most are the people most like them lmao
And the Poles in Poland 
And the prospective head of Dept of Energy wanted to cut the Dept of Energy, but forgot he wanted to do that on stage in the 2012 primary debate 😂 
And the QBs are playing from a tee up from the pros
And the Ravens are dominating 
And the Russian withdrawal from the west bank of the Dniper which is going to be a bloodbath, but that’s a different type of content
And the shot in the face comparison works there too!
And the solution was the Schiano Plan
And the Texans have been boned by injuries
And the thrill of trying to remind a zombie that he owes you $200k
And the Warriors just signed some Gay named Rudy. When will it end 🤮 
And the warriors were bringing up the ball so fast it was often not a set halfcourt offense 
And the weed
And their “skills”
And their 6th round pick was just shot
And their advice to win support: yell at them
And their middle names as Rodrigo and Rogerio 
And then another good transition to why people choose instead to just say nothing because they will be tarred and feathered for questioning the cultural Marxist viewpoint
And then ask one of your classmates if I can buy a copy of MS Office
And then God was so pissed when we lost that he did COVID 
And then I look at the junior enlisted and say “so y’all are the top 23% huh”
And then these patches were made
And then they asked me to donate
And then you doubled down on your commitment when Becker asked
And there could be legitimate reasons that aren’t just bureaucratic bull shit, I just haven’t read about any
And there is serious risk in operations without strategy. But it doesn’t mean operations should cease
And there may have been a famous one regarding the Pats but can’t remember it 
And there will be a large caveat that the model does not account for Trump rejecting the results or some other anti-democracy authoritarian BS
And there, Changing his official name To War Machine is not even close to the most insane stuff he’s done
And there’s a huge difference between Alabama’s dominance and every other team in any other league, except probably UConn women’s b-ball  
And there’s a legit chance he could get in serious legal trouble for this so that’s a plus
And therefore be eligible for the draft a year early? Nah kids a natural brainiac
And therefore never getting to experience the Soy Sauce Oreo
And therein lies the issue. It's your assessment of player value that determines the rule. That's bullshit
And these are the "good guys" IMO. Like I said, clusterfuck
And these are the same folks who say “all cops are bastards” and also “Hamas doesn’t represent all the peaceful Palestinians”
And these in 7th grade
And they always had these bullshit tailgates where the burgers tasted like shit
And they brought up John Rocker and a famous SI article from 1999, which I had to check out
And they don’t offer refunds lol
And they don’t technically get paid for spring training
And they renounced Randle 👀 
And they said the technology didn’t exist 
And they want to blame outgroups for their problems
and they wanted to be star-bellied sneetches, whose bellies had stars, but the plain bellied sneetches had none upon thars
and they’re supposed to make that call in a split second in real time??
And they're black
and this is how don feels about it
And this is mostly just a devils advocate idea. I don't actually think this is a good ready to implement plan
And this is the contents
And this is the fixed version. Still a success story
And this patriot. Thank you for your service 
And those who do know stuff usually approach a topic with subtlety and uncertainty, which doesn’t get upvotes 
And to be clear, I think I’m still largely on that train too. But I’m not as diehard now as I was 6-12 months ago
And to stop the 4peat
And to the only person I started every week this season:
And todays tbh
And trump sure as hell wasnt biased against during the primaries, so it definitely isn't inherent. 
and Ukrainian 
And United PR handled it terribly
And until 200 years ago, that was the case for most of the world
And upon 3rd look I need to lower speak now too
And watching the Superb Owl
And we allowed Marcus to self glorify as 5/5 on picking the perfect FLB so he could shut up and we could order breakfast
And we both lose survivor pool lmao
And we can donate it to the JJ Watt charity
And we don’t even have to change Marika’s nickname
And we know you don’t want that
And we see Winnie the Pooh 
And we should add them to the ledger
And we shouldn’t have to defend shit. We’ve been over this. 
And we’d float like 10 feet from herds of Water buffalo. There are soooo many here
And we’ll both be TDY in Phoenix AZ for about a month in Jan/Feb, so that’s lucky
And what are the major international team tournaments besides the World Cup and Olympics?
And what are you trying to do post MBA?
And what if I think he'll be top 10 ROS?
And what is injured for 9 months? What'd you tear your rotator cuff?
And what policy do we adopt if Russia continues to be hawks with Ukraine, and start to do the same in other former USSR states?
And what's the maturity date?
"And when his girlfriend calls him out on it... 

""You're saying that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that it was me, not you, who bought her the salad?!""

""Yes that's what I'm saying""

""...whaaaaa?"""
And when the decision came to say “hmm do I really wanna do this to prove a point” the answer was no
And when you make a correct prediction, you say ayatollahdyouso
And where are the written rules?
And while they share the division, they're not really a rival...
And who benefits the most? The fans, that’s who. 
And who could forget: "Obamacare? More like LOLbamacare!"
And who is paying for these things?
And will fuller only got $10M for one year
And willie wonka 
And with that, Joe jumps into fourth place on the conservative asshole power rankings 
And with those 2 we probably wouldn’t need a hard reset
And worst call in the history of the Olympics 
And would take too long 
And Wyndham had the one clutch 3 wood on 14
And y’all clowns said “wow we just picked the team that will finish last in the division”
And yeah the crutches were like $900
And yeah we do look alike lol
And YES I WOULD because I'm #OTFSquad till I die
And yes you can average the two odds together if it’s 50/50
And yes, as Joe said we have won like 25 straight wars. Last loss was 79 days ago ;)
And yes, the very first thing I did was a barrel roll
And yet becker you were willing to have a net negative present value on a trade last year...
And yet I see no vitriolic posts on an IG story 🤔 
And yet somehow rap is still my top category?
And yet the guy stays the announcer?!?! Does he even root for Wake??
And yet the mainstream media picks up this story and runs with it because why the fuck not, it's the mainstream media, helping make America dumber yet again
And yet Trump won. So by that logic either Hillary wasn’t liberal enough, or she was just a uniquely bad candidate. 
And yet you did, and I didn’t 
And yet you pushed the Jordy trade through last year 
And yet, it’s only cultural relevance is in porn
And you absolutely get Watson if you can. Who among us hasn’t accidentally grazed our penis on an IG masseuse 18 separate times?
And you already said it's not a dimness answer
And you can come hang out with me in Jersey City for lunch if you so desire
And you can see the danger of letting the government define morality, right?
And you can't use iPads because you'd probably have to convert the entire NFL infrastructure to apple products in order to integrate with them
And you have the nerve to call your team "Paper Ticket"
And you literally admitted that you were also trying to trade rape John hahaha
And you literally just said "this will be even easier than I thought"
And you repeatedly been giving ME shit for missing the weekend
"And you responded:
Eat
My
Cock"
And you should consider yourself lucky since you had no punishment for the Fuckholes Open loss
And you stop getting closer at level 20?
And you’re saying “your one vote doesn’t matter” and I’m saying it does, because everybody’s vote matters, because that’s literally how elections work, you ignoramus
And you’re welcome for clarifying in your favor 
And your DT would catapult over the OL
And your last name is something like “Marcel” or “Remy”
And you're giving away an equal amount of money
And you're right, you said "easier on me" not "more convenient"
And...
and... *looks down*... with these hands
And/or not enough RAM. I too have googled this in the past lol
And/or some famous pornstars
Andi, I would imagine

Andrew Beck-LOL-er 
Andrew is a Giants fan and that's about it. Kevin doesn't care about sports, or anything for that matter
Andrew Jackson joined the revolution at 13. He was captured as a POW and refused to clean a British officers boots, earning him a slash of a sword in the FACE. Fucking badass.
Andrew Jackson took out Brady and Nomar lol. That guy is the bane of New England
Andrew Jackson, who died 15 years before the start of the civil war, was really angry about the Civil War. Why was there even the civil war anyway? People don't ask that question
Andrew Luck 🐐
Andrew McCutchen??

ANESTO
Anesto #tbting hard on snap story 🙌🏼
Anesto back referring to celebrities as “we”. I’m loving it 🤩🤩🤩
Anesto claims he's fluent in Spanish but I've never heard him speak anything but the simplest of phrases 
"Anesto Claims Power Rankings:
1) NFL
2) Olympics
3) Party with Chris Brown
4) Intl celebrity w/ paparazzi
5) Miguel Cotto Lambo
6) GQ Model"
"Anesto fan power rankings:
1) #TeamKelleher
2) Joey B
3) Jeff?
4) ??"
Anesto is back on Snapchat 
Anesto is not a 🐐 he is undefinable, unlabelable, and uncategorizable 
Anesto levels of confidence+wrongness
Anesto Snapchat wow great way to start the day
Anesto takes all his dance videos and photo shoots like half a mile from my office. I always cross my fingers I run into him after work
Anesto was in our grade at BC for ~1.2 years. He was most famous for his frequent, high profile outlandish claims of athleticism, such as claiming he will start as BC’s QB next year despite not being on the team. His braggadocio (and general behavior) grated on some folks and got him into some altercations with primarily other athletes. He spiraled into insanity, publishing evidence of it himself on Facebook, before leaving BC sometime first semester sophomore year.
Anesto was talking in a group about how he doesn't drink or do drugs cause he's such a fine athlete and that would affect the his ability to perform properly. Danny said, and I'm paraphrasing here, "fuck you nigga I could beat your dumb ass high as hell in bball and you wouldn't be able to do shit nigga" so anesto, being the true competitor he is accepted the challenge
Anesto with a great IG day, featuring a hilarious dance video, the hashtags #pornhub and #pornstar, and the return of fake Caribbean accent
Anesto with the double 2014 football reposts, what a great day
Anesto 😘
Anesto?
Anestos peak was summer 2014
Angela
Angela rn
Angela said that. I mean it’s pretty clear
"Angela: “I hope he’s not dreaming about other girls”

Goody: ^^"
Angels got ohtani
Angels is ANAELs
ANGRY PEYTON
Ankara?
AnnapLOLis
Announcers are convinced there’s a tip 🤔 
Anomaly in terms of few and low priced contracts
Anonymous Camel is a real jokester
Anonymous reddit posters have literally never been wrong
Another “pick 3” on twitter
Another 24 karat gold post from Jacob Wohl, smartest and handsomest man of all time
Another A+ Anesto snap story
Another bad call lmao
Another big deal vote today. Kurdistan is voting on whether or not to declare independence and make itself a new country.
Another builder to fix things right before the Pats opening day 🤔 
Another classic
Another day, another 100 million contract 
Another element from the Darnold trade is that you can draft a QB high, have him suck (but show potential, not Josh Rosen level suck) and still be able to flip him for a second
Another example is when I wanted to have an RHA event where BC juniors and seniors would advise freshmen on academic major advice, BC nixed it last minute because they were afraid I would expose the fact that not all classes and professors are identical and that some are better than others...
Another example of you philistines not appreciating language art
another exciting groupme catchup awaits
Another eye opening experience I’ve had here is working with the 18-19 year olds and realizing how inept many of them are. Basic math, reading comprehension, ability to speak and present for 2 minutes... before this pretty much everybody I knew had gone to college, and those things were taken for granted
Another fantasy topic. We increased to 3 IR spots because of corona. There is no “corona only” IR list. We either gentleman’s agreement to not use the 3rd spot for non-corona IR, or we just allow regular use of all 3 spots. The default is the latter
Another feature of an 8 team league 
Another from the PCPSR poll
Another fumble. First play.
Another fun fact about polls and stats: apparently there is a negative (though not statistically significant) relationship between national primary poll results and actual success in the Iowa Caucus and NH Primary
Another fun fact: 60% of white Republicans in Iowa voted for either a Hispanic or black candidate
Another giant lol
Another Giants fan ;)
Another government agency that sucks at their primary function?!
Another great idea by #TeamKelleher
Another great part was Greenberg texting Stone that because he's got a family and 2 young kids, he needs to do whats best for him regarding the situation with him buying sex from a bunch of teenagers
another hit for the “your vote doesn’t matter” crew
Another huge if true, for many reasons. 1) The EU member states might actually be unifying, we’ll see which states actually provides the aircraft. 2) The EU believes the Ukrainian defense can remain operationally conventional, ie not an insurgency, which means 3) the EU believes Ukraine has a shot at not losing
Another lol. Not really my category tho
Another mildly 🔥 take: trump doesn't actually know what's in AHCA and what its consequences are, he just wants it to pass because it's the first thing he'd have actually done and he can't stomach it being shut down by his own party
Another one: Seattle led the league in points against, becoming the first team (in SB era) to do so 4 years in a row
Another person we “named” was this fucking drifter who kept showing up at the trail towns. He was cracked out as hell, definitely hitch hiked from town to town, and always begged for money. We called him “who mans” because every time we saw him, “YO WHO MANS THIS IS”
Another pic of narrows
Another postmortem:
Another projection from RedState
Another reason I hate the FDA
Another reason not to fly RyanAir
Another show that’s holds up great is Workaholics
Another solid Anesto snap today. Got some singing, some flexing, some bold athletic claims, and some ice cold takes on Deflategate
Another step to the right for future Republican megadonor Andrew Becker
Another Titans coach also tested positive. No announcement of a change/forfeit  yet 
Another tuddy for the NERSSSS baby

Anyway, the three of them are creeped out as fuck and ask me to tell him to remove it, because it's fucking weird. I'm just like uhh idk how this is gonna go over, but a few days later, he shows up at our door randomly to hang out or something. And the first thing on my mind is the Profile Pic. I say "oh hey Steve um so you know Jenna and Jessie and Jillian right?" His face lights up like oh yeah I love those girls. The awkwardness is hitting me like a ton of bricks as I say "umm yeahhhh so they were really drunk when they met you and don't really remember it and would prefer it if they weren't in your fb profile pic..."  His face goes sullen and he grumbles "oh well I remember everyone I meet" and walks away and I'm tingling with awkwardness. I guess later that day he changed it and deleted them as friends on fb...

Appreciate that but tbh that shouldn't even factor in. Ideal time to blank slate for those 2 was when Goody quit, but that didn't happen. I think nobody wants to have to deal with the shit for 3 more years
Appreciate the advice. Problem is all of those solutions hurt me in my own firm because my boss is the only person who i work with from my own firm. Id need to get another internal person on my side to make sure my boss doesn't rate me poorly.

As far as I know, no state or policy had a particularly effective or ineffective solution
As for actual views on policy, I'd say 25%. For media publicized personality,45%. For don't decide until the last minute (aka who's left and popular), 30%
As for cost of college, it’s bananas. Lots of theories exist, but some of the smarter ones I’ve read focus on 1) the shift of subsidization from the supply side to the demand side, and 2) the non academic administration balloon. Both would appear to be solvable, but the top tier schools don’t need to atm because there’s no shortage of demand, even as tuition skyrockets
As for the university perspective, I could see a transition back to academia and less on "campus life". I think lots of non-academic staffers are non essential and are only employed because they can be afforded
As for vaccine refusers, yeah I'd say 20-25% is about right. 10% of Americans are insane (weirdly constant across various conspiracy theories, like moon landing, chemtrails, etc.) And 10-15% is my guesstimate for holdouts.  It's possible that number wanes as more people get it, but idk

At some point during the league rules discussion, where I somehow got each Of you to opine on additional player slots, keeper cost increases, max keepers, and $ trading, I also raised the question of buy in. I said it stays at $50 unless anybody objects.

At the end of the day i think individual behavior is the biggest factor
At the FH Austin trip when Marcus was betting over unders on the girls time on the mechanical bull, he didn’t ask for permission 
At the same time yeah NH is looking awful so far. Somewhat to be expected because the campaign ads were huge there for Bush and Trump. Rubio is huuuuugely underperforming, which is going to be a major test for the campaign. Cruz was wxpected to do bad based on polls, but he's relying on Super Tuesday in March, when basically all the SEC states go on one day. Trump winning sucks, but it's consistent with his polls and he doesn't appear to be going up or down much, amazingly. 
At the same time, Blaine is essentially a replacement level standard QB, and Kaep does have athletic upside that chip miiiiight be able to leverage... 
At the same time, the risk reward of the QBs psyche could be big too. If brown led a 2 play drive into FG range, that could be huge at the end of the half
At the very least continue for men
At the very least, they probably wouldn’t advocate shooting people on Twitter 
At the very least, you've clearly given up on Murray being a top 8 RB so I'm feeling pretty confident about that second $50 bet
At their best: Dez, TY Hilton, Tyreek Hill, Julio, OBJ
At this distance, you’ll even have to take the Coriolis effect into account 
At this point he's not too dissimilar from Cudi with the 2 garbage ass experimental albums in a row. Obviously way bigger before the crash but still
At this point I’d rather pirate. Screw them for not supporting the troops
At this point I’m happy I shared Micayla with y’all just for the gold #content
At this point I'd prefer a reasonable floor of not being a joke
At this point it doesn’t look like it would be much of a difference no
At this point it’s gotta be probable that the protests played some role in the new spike right?
At this point the Kaepernick takes are 99% libtard screeching. All actual football fans have moved on
At this point tough to tell. It’s the third major foreign policy firing in the past 2 weeks, so it’s possible to see changes in the foreign policy front. Trump has seemed to favor tougher talking guys who put diplomacy on the back burner and favor aggressive rhetoric, but it’s more likely than not that it will just be a change of rhetoric for whatever that’s worth. Withdrawing from the Iran Deal is now much more likely. Increased military opposition to the Assad regime is more likely than before but probably not gonna change. Same deal with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. No idea with regards to North Korea. 
At this point yeah. South Park as a whole is better but last 2-3 seasons have been disappointing
At this point, the rioting is way worse than just the property damage caused

Barring any late surprises it appears the troops win again
Barry bonds is the only member of the 500-500 club, and the only member of the 400-400 club
Barry Bonds is the only player to ever to get on base more times than his number of ABs, and nobody else is even close

Base running fundamentals again. In the freaking World Series
Base yes. But it’s not nagys fault Trubisky has no field vision and awful decision making 
Baseball all time gotta be Reggie Jackson
Baseball games unlikely to play too
Baseball grip. Or you don’t interlock or overlap
Baseball is all about the one in a million. They're the greatest moments in the sport
Baseball is back baby!
Baseball is the most individual of the team sports. Cant see an argument against it really
Baseball players are threatening to boycott spring training Damn. 
Baseball revenue sharing pales in comparison to the other sports 
Baseball vs CFB
Baseballs the only one right? No profit sharing, attendance drives revenue
Based on pickup location, they can from off anywhere 
Based on that, I'd estimate Ansar Al Sham has at least 25,000
Based on what I’ve read, The exposure to outside air and length of exposure both continue to be the main determinants of infection. So hopefully these outdoor parties aren’t as bad as they might look
Based on what you said it almost seems like she wants you to say "hey you're the fucking worst", then she'll say "you passed the test" and be the nicest person ever
Basic pow rights... You realize who were talking about here right?
Basically a mini-insurance firm
Basically Adidas is the one financing the bribe, the money is fronted by agents, AAU programs are totally complicit, and they all expect to have the players future business when he goes pro
Basically agreeing with you
Basically an extremely high stakes game of spikeball 
Basically diminishes the rewards of the worst tanker. But i suppose it incentivizes a race to the bottom ~6 instead of the bottom 2
Basically eliminates Kasich Carly and Paul. Bush might stick around since he has so much money but who knows. Trump losing by >5% might be big since he talks about polls so much. Rubio at 20% is good for momentum and above expectations, but still third.
Basically gave a not so subtle middle finger to Trump 
Basically go to college, get a skill degree that you can use to earn money, not have to take the liberal arts classes (saving time and money), and graduate

Basically I don't think there's a way to make the D league "respectable" enough to work in relegation system other than to start giving them revenue sharing with the NBA teams
Basically I think dependent on how bad a "replacement level" RB2 is, Becker might have a point
Basically I want to know if I should remove the film layer or leave it
Basically if players make money off their own likeness, there’s nothing to stop college boosters from “buying a top recruits autograph” for $100000 with a “hey there’s a lot more of that at X college”. It would turn college sports into a bidding war and make the NCAA a ~10 team league determined by booster money
Basically if the Dems win, it's a huge middle finger to Trump.
Basically if three year letterman was an NCAA coach, but without the championship rings
Basically I'm on Team Swamp
Basically I'm way too casual and informal, my deliverables are good but I'm not taking any steps to manage upward, assist the account, grow my career, etc 
Basically it looked like Eric adams was running away with it, but then all of a sudden Kathryn Garcia jumped up to a near tie supposedly due to ranked choice voting, but the numbers changes are so drastic that nobody appears to have any clue what’s going on

Basically just will do anything without shame to get what they want and fuck everybody else
Basically keep your computer running to be used as a server for other people to download the torrent. 
Basically someone who supports the stalin/mao brand of socialism, but also often someone who is so anti-America that they end up shilling for awful regimes around the world, like Cuba, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, etc.
Basically standard, except one less point for each FG
Basically the “did we just become best friends?” Scene from stepbrothers 
Basically the anti-NC law. All public school students in America can use the bathroom that they identify with 
basically the exact opposite of Mac Jones, who clearly loves Lemon Pepper Wings
Basically the only thing that could keep Obamacare afloat organically is tons of healthy people signing up for Obamacare, which they would never do because they already have private insurance 
Basically their celebrity status enabled them to pique interest to let them in the deal
Basically what John said. Also, the number of undecideds is huge.
Basically you're charging Marcus 1.5x the keeper value, and with a fee equal to that markup
Basically, ~40% of the US is poor as fuck. That number is much lower in the other countries where this thing can work.

Becker it essentially just exposed that many politicians are dodging taxes. The way they do so is through a complex network of funding that is difficult to trace, and leads to companies that are incorporated in tax havens (like British Virgin Islands) being the ones who report the income, and they don't have to pay taxes on it. 
Becker it seems like you’re very onboard with the giants FA strategy
Becker it's been 4 seasons of that. We're kind of immune at this point

Becker universities have no incentive to reduce tuition, because so far, people will pay whatever they charge. And people will pay partially due to the student loans being given out like candy. The colleges must have some skin in the game to reduce costs

Becker's write up definitely the best of the season. Though I did laugh at James Jones and Allen Hurns being solidly consistent, but then Lacy, TY Hilton, and Megatron being full of question marks

Been going ham on hearthstone. Highly recommend to anyone. It's free on your phone too. 
Been happening to me a lot recently 
Been here over 18 months now
Been reading about how things might get awkward with IT if the Cs get the top pick and draft Fultz, considering the FA aspect and everything
Been reading about that too. Everything I've read is more or less speculation, and they really can't pinpoint why. My hypothesis is that last year was inflated due to DFS, and this year is closer to the true ratings mark. Personally, I watch the same amount as last year
Been real quiet after going 1/6 on Super Bowl bets

Belichick on the other hand, there's a 🐐. The dude has proven that he will do absolutely anything to win, including cheating and lying about cheating without betraying any emotions. He doesn't give a fuck about the media or the other owners or anyone. He also is the only reason Tom Brady is any good, so this BB is the BB that gets my vote. 
Believe it or not, we used to talk fantasy football in here
Believe so

Bell losing that leverage by the minute 
Bell to the Chiefs
Bell, it doesn't keep the data from 2013 so I have no clue 
Bellarmine got to the state championship with a pure double wing offense in like 2012 and it was the most boring fucking thing I’ve ever seen. Every single play was a triple option for 7 yards because our QB and HBs were huge. 
Bellarmine is on house of highlights for best belly flop 🤔 
Bellarmine is rich as fuck, so... no...
Bellarmine. Second most adversity, second highest SAT score. Truly the top of the power rankings   
Bellinger is a sleeper too
Beltre?
Ben Wallace?
Benched not injured. I think you know the answer to that question haha. Wouldn't be surprised to see the Niners to draft a QB in Deshaun Watson or Trubisky or even Kizer, but they have such major holes at every position that nobody knows

Bernie has become a real destructive and division causing figure in the party. At a time they need unity more than ever
Bernie has thrived off reinforcing the idea that the fat cat elites are evil and greedy, when in reality, they’re a lot more like him
Bernie is not a nuanced politician. His whole message is totally contrary to what’s been revealed about him since he reluctantly released his tax returns
Bernie is so full of shit. “If I am president, everything is gonna be amazing”
Bernie sanders unironically asks the same question
Bernie was done long ago. You heard it from me forever; he only has a shot in Iowa NH and VT
Bernie’s answer is the same for literally everything. Everything is the fault of the corrupt system.

Black swan meaning an unexpected event
Black turnout went down the tubes
Black Twitter is now having the cake vs pie argument lmao how about that
Black Twitter was having a very good discussion yesterday on their problems with the BLM movement. Gist of it was that they refuse to foster a two sided discussion. I was impressed by the self awareness and honestly of the conversation
Blah Plah

Blake Bortles has only 1 🐐 quality: the ability to put up stellar fantasy points while still being one of the worst QBs in the league (see Josh Freeman in 2012). Otherwise he's just a shitty QB with a girlfriend who has big cans.
Blake Bortles should watch Steph Curry film to learn how to look away the defense
Blame Title IX?
Blank slate and highest bid by anybody at any point
Blank slate and start from scratch. Then we know from then on
Blank slate end of year agreed
Blasts from the past those names are

Blocked punt, return for TD, penalty on excessive celebration. Oh wait no he stepped out at the 4, so 19 yard line after the penalty. Field goal.

Bloomberg a major factor in Texas
Bloomberg and Klobuchar seemed to understand that
Bloomberg is as sexist and racist as trump is a galaxy brain take
Bloomberg should’ve used his $500 million to buy Samoa, not win Samoa
Blount holy cow
Blue
Blue Devil, Red Dick 
Blue since that’s what the group plays at
Blue/white combo. I had a lot of second shots that landed on the green and rolled to the fringe, so it was essentially but not technically a 2 putt

Bold words Jeff after telling us all mike lapointes brother knocked up a chick from our grade
Bolivia or Paraguay?
Bolivia. But it lasted like 20 minutes and failed
Bonds got IBB'd every time he had a chance
Bonds is probably the most underrated player of all time
Bonds isn’t an asshole he’s a legend and great guy fuck you
Bonds, Papi, Clemens, Schilling, A-Rod, Sosa would all get my vote. Borderline on Helton, Manny, and Kent.
Bonds/Mays/Aaron/Babe
Bonds? Griffey? Thomas?

Bonus if that person is Liz T

Boob guy or butt guy?
Booked for $50
Booker gives me playoff loser vibes. Like similar to Harden but worse
Booker should be out with 6. That was an intentional and they somehow didn’t call it

Boston != Massachusetts bruh come on
Boston and DC are tied for being awesome. The best food I had in Alamogordo was when Guillermo’s wife would bring foil wrapped tamales to softball tournaments
Boston Calling but none of you losers want to go
Boston College “Cleveland Browns” Eagles
Boston College “Green Bay Packers” Eagles
Boston College aka Quad Squad U 💪🏼 
Boston fans is this guy a joke?
Both
Both are acceptable 
Both are totally plausible hahaha
Both are true
Both are true. There comes a point where taking a shot on a -EV replacement HC is still preferable to Gus Bradley
Both Eli’s are trash 
Both finish outside RB25 $20
Both highest scorer and most expensive 
Both it looks like. Coverage has been really good, but receivers haven't been getting open and luck hasn't been hitting spots
Both joined the best team possible 
Both mainstream peeing methods are normal. The sitting is normal, standing is weird (1). Folding is normal, crumpling is weird, but The Hybrid is the weirdest (2). Sample size is still too small, but so far rewiping is normal, and one-and-done is weird (3). 
Both not easy to get into the city. JFK has public right there, LGA you have to take a cab. EWR is similar to JFK
Both of their eldest kids are Marines
Both of them just spoke. Bloomberg isn't a great speaker but he's straight to the point, honest, and clearly very smart. Kaine is a moderate Democrat with a lot of charisma, also came up with Jesuit education and his son is a Marine. Bloomberg said he wasn't running only because he'd hurt her.  
Both of them went from the conf champion to the best team possible. But Lebron has come home and been forgiven. That's the only difference 
Both of these guys have such easy cop outs and they know it. Any time they're stumped, "but Trump/Hillary is a horrible person" and they're both right 
Both of those movies had zero cultural impact
Both of those places are worse than dominos. 
Both of those trades have the same likelihood of happening
Both offenses have been bad. Bills had one good drive all game
Both on offense and defense
Both parties would be better served by nominating more Joe Manchins / Adam Kinzingers and fewer AOCs/Hawleys but the libcucks and MAGAists are trying their hardest to keep losing
Both products of Jeff “The QB Whisperer” Fisher 
Both semifinals are super close
Both teams are like 1/8 combined from 3 feet
Both the entire antiracism industry and accenture exploiting it
Both Thompsons are wow
Both those things have something in common: the target was valuable
Both wagers placed on FriendZone (ad)
Both went to Penn State, which lapped the field and continues to be the most dominant program in all of college sports with 11 of the last 13 titles 
Both, as is Emyr
Bots been 🔥 recently

Bottom 3 (that I’ve seen): shape of water, the artist, the hurt locker

Bottom half of the league in EPA+CPOE or QBR

Bottom of the power rankings, even for me
Bottom of the power rankings: Brazil nuts

Boys I’m bored as hell quarantining in a hotel in Sumter SC for the next week so if anybody wants to have a catch-up phone call, I’d love it
Boys I’ve done it again
Boys they are not flying night sorties on Friday so I can get out early. We can move up the draft several hours if that’s preferable for y’all.
Boys this is my time to shine
Bracing for lockdown part 3 
Bracket for sure 
Bradford looks bad yeah. Missed a wide open Diggs for a sure TD
Bradley Cooper and Harrison ford are not in the same ballpark
Brady and BB, both masters on the field, horrifically awkward in any other setting. No wonder they won 6 Super Bowl 
Brady is gonna have an aneurism
Brady is so good 
Brady Quinn since he cried on draft night
Brady sneak to seal it 
Brady sucked for half of last year too. Still expect him to be among the best 
Brady throws looking like they’re missing the zing
Brady will never win another super bowl
Brady would have 0 rushing yards and also cause a loss
Brady, Cam, Rodgers, Brees, Luck are prob my top 5. Then I guess Wilson, Jameis, then Ryan Carr Mariota
Brady. Bird. Ted Williams. Pedro?
Brady’s passes look a bit wounded ducky
Bradys fades all his shots and Peyton draws/hooks them
Brag brag: Brandi Chastain is the assistant coach of mmmBellarmine soccer
Brain teaser: There are 8 balls that look exactly the same, one weighs slightly more than the others. You have a balancing scale. What is the minimum number of measurements you need to determine which ball is the heavy one?

Bridge water is better than lock no doubt
Bridge water is where Rob (former roommate) worked. Incredibly strong company culture that requires you to immerse in it fully or quit in a year, but also one of the biggest and best hedge funds in the world that will cut red tape to reward it's best employees.
Bridgewater 😳
Briefly, heard they dumped it when it had side effects
Briefly. For like 2 months maybe
Bring a Kirk Cousins jersey and see if he’ll sign it
Bring back madden camera 
Bring it bitch
Bring on trey lance. Jimmy G sucks
Bring out a starter if you need
Brings up a good point tho. Do we wanna discuss next years amendments right after the season ends, or late in the offseason season? I vote the former
Brissett is better than almost every first round QB the past 2 seasons. 
Brissett to Indy for Phillip Dorsett 👀

Bro gotta increase your exposure to the flavor profile
Bro just throw it away. You could see that coming in slow motion
Broad daylight, a block from union square. For his Rolex 
Brock been better than I thought, but might be because raiders D is exhausted 
Brock is the biggest enigma to me because all signs point to him being elite. But the shadow of Shanny bringing Jimmy G (literally worse than Aiden O’Connell) to the super bowl looms too large
Brock Lesnar and Cain Velasquez’s entire careers have started and ended since Nogueira held his title
Brock LOLsweiler
Brock needs to fucking chill man
Brock needs to get a completion streak and get that big cock confidence back

Btw zero mention of the Trevor Bauer situation in here. Cannot believe the new development
Btw, New favorite hot take:
"Btw, update on the Ukraine war. Mariupol surrendered last week, and since then the Russians have focused all their efforts on a relatively small area but meaningful offensive in Luhansk in the east, and have been slow but successful. It appears they are trying to cut off and surround a Ukrainian position at Sieverodonetsk. 

But basically, the Russians have significantly reduced their scope of operations and have been successful so far. For the first time in a while, the Russians have been making incremental but steady progress in their advance. "

Buddy threw lightning hands all fight, plus a few sweet low kicks, then giant right 1-2 elbow, then a follow up left elbow on the ground
Buddy was like an army doctor or something. Didn’t know what his unit did. Like were they infantry, armor, aviation, artillery, etc.

Bumgarner did exactly that in Game 7 of the 2014 World Series, after pitching games 1 and 4. Came in in the 5th and pitched 5 shutout innings
Bumgarner 🐐
Bunch of gays. Biden’s America smh
Bunch of rockets fired from Gaza. News saying the iron dome didn’t intercept them all
Bundle rooski and bundlay savay are tied for worst
Burgers. Fried chicken. Pasta.
Burlingame Ave is out of the way (near San Mateo) but it's a cool little downtown area. It also is home of La Corneta, which Joe Bourque claims is "the best burrito I've ever had"
Burlingame OG
Bush : Iraq :: Obama : Syria is one of my favorite discussion topics 
Bush is not going to win the primary. If Bush takes out Rubio just to place 4th in NH, that means Cruz wins and the Bush campaign would be one of the most expensive, biggest backfire events in modern US politics.
Business analyst testing. It's an intermediary step of software development where the BA tests semi-complete code and makes sure it's all working as expected.

Busy day at Ross 
Busy Tuesday @Channing Tatum ?
But "batting runs" is a derivative of "weighted runs above average", which is its own derivative of "weighted on base average"...
But 99% of terrorists are Muslim
But a black reporter asked him if he'd meet with the Black Caucus and he said "Oh are they friends of yours?!"
But a key point is that the freedom of speech defense doesn’t hold water when Harvard et al have been largely anti free speech for the past 5+ years
But a lot of people were clowns. I remember having that conversation several times  
But a very few who are hot and want to bang me
But according to the A+ journalism on the left, you wouldn't feel that way if she was a MAN!
But actively wanting the USPS to fail is stupid
But actually a well-executed heartwarming underdog sports team movie/tv show seems to be a guaranteed success
But actually don’t you pay Union fees for this stuff? So you don’t have to email the president a copy pasta that will probably just make his eyes roll
But actually I guess he never input his address 
But actually I have the most interactions with marines and soldiers. Soldiers are generally worse but there’s the most of them. Very little interaction with sailors and coasties 
But actually I think obesity is a really good signal that one doesn't care to monitor their health. And health insurance companies can't change a higher rate based on it, which I find terribly ironic
But actually probably the reposa fight 
But actually, in addition to team success, things like campus, culture, coaching, other recruits, how hot the girls are, how good the school is, etc. matter magnitudes more than the logo on the swag
But actually, quick moment of silence for @Champion ‘11 & ‘20, diehard royalist, who will be grieving for Prince Philip all weekend
But Afghanistan doesn't really have much of a central govt so it's more tribal 
But Again, if that’s the difference in semantics, the rubicon has already been crossed
But agree that Hillary NEEDS MI to win
But alas, I did not win the league, so in the immortal words of Beck, I'm a #LoserBabySoWhyDontYouKillMe
But all those guys came with giant price tags. Ohtani’s risk is nothing
But also congrats on BU
But also lmao deez nuts jokes are always funny
But also, the irony of Trump being hurt by lies and potentially false leaks is delicious 
But American Chop Suey? Totally normal 
But Angela doesn’t, at least not tonight 
But anyway before the digression, the question I was trying to ask was: if the main problem with the current healthcare industry is paying for those 5% of patients, is there a better way than the status quo?
But as a preface, he majorly fucked up the situations in Iraq, Syria, Iran, Egypt, Libya, and Ukraine. And he's flip flopped on foreign policy decisions so many times our allies can no longer trust him
But as a stat counter like most fans, you see a gap at WR
But as for "And how could it? There's too much money that will make sure everything stays the way it is", that's bullshit Bernie Bro demagoguery. You better than that b
But as you can see I don’t totally hate it
But at least double calories 
But at least they’re still playing football
But at least you have the conviction to stand behind your stance, so i guess that’s respectable 
But at the same time packers run D is league bottom so it could certainly work
But at the same time that’s what you get for buying BBB
But at this point, would you rather have drafted fields or traded for Russ. Idk how you can say the latter 
But back to the first hot take, how many of those guys are truly better than KD?
But backer you hate baseball too so why do you extra hate it for kids?
But becker I’m getting the vibe you might be predisposed to feel that way for some reason
But becker was the conductor of the hype train
But becker you’re pretty much guaranteed to win
But Bergman could hit 300 every year for the rest of his career and I bet he doesn’t get in
But between the loose alliances, state funded militias, indiscriminate regard for who is civilian and who is militant, religious motivation, etc... it looks a lot like Syria.
But both of you had ridiculously good RB keepers so not surprising
But box of pro vs is the right answer
But Brady is #1 in the NFL
But can he run a 4.2 tho
But can she kick flip
But Cash smh that’s unforgivable 
But check if they make you buy a gi, those things are like $130
But check the fat on that left arm though...
But Clemson didn't score first?
But colts cowboys titans and browns are all good wins
But come on guys it's not like this has been a new development lmao
But could he break a 630 mile
But could they be funged?
But couldn't what you said be applied to Spaz? He only had 2 bad years after 2 good ones.
But did anybody see the box score on the Michigan-Gers game?  Oh my sweet baby Jesus...
But do they have 50 different words for snow
But do you feel uncomfortable?
But do you know what day the first guy is picked?
But due to reporting lags the 7 day average is the better metric 
But ease to play pickup is key
But easy one is “very legal, and very cool”
But either way, this is the first time the Russians are on the retreat on an operational scale since the war began in February 
But even if, nah I'm gonna keep it
But fair point. He counts
But first, can we define 🐐 ?
But for Adams at 27 not Tyreek at 38
But for counties 
But for different reasons than goody. I just think I'll be able to get by without major stress
But for real i guarantee Nate silver would bet the over on Biden at 7:1
But for real I’m think reposa is a decent dude and we just ran into each other at a bad time
But for real it pains me to no end that America has chosen to fight the political opposition with fire, and it has led to things like the congressional baseball game shootings, vehicular man slaughter, and mail bombs  
But for real the reason I said the China thing was worse is because 1) he was supposedly a champion of social justice 2) it was totally unprompted, not part of a greater social wave 3) he said educate yourself lmfao
But for real though how many of those pitchers do you recognize. I'm at 1
But for real, I shudder to think what Rapey Don would do in relations with normal allies like Mexico UK and EU, let alone deal with China Russia and most importantly Turkey
But for real, the Ders are anemic on offense, porous OL, no separation by any receiver. Best plays are jet sweeps and screens. They’re also pitiful on defense, awful pass rush, coverage assignments blown regularly. The Bills would probably beat them at this point
But for those of the many that have been asking that’s what the champ looks like doing a warm up swing
But freshman year kinda sucked tho ngl
BUT from what I understand it’s a last resort option, like if you’d otherwise be homeless 
But generally being bad at run D is whatever unless it’s so bad you can’t stop a 4th quarter clock killing drive
But golly did Don ask for it this time lmao what an idiot
But goodwin id probably vote neither and hide behind the "I live in a deep blue state" excuse 
But Gorsuch!!
But he didn’t know what it meant lmfao
But he does have a point. If he doesn't win the league, this is a negative for him 
But he has a precedent of being a lazy motherfucker, so fuck him
But he looooooves hashtags
But he’s a very solid softball player 
But he’s gonna nail it tiger style
But he’s the one who just tweeted it’s him, not the Dems 
But here's my 2 cents: making a sweeping presidential decree on a majorly divisive issue that affects 0.3% of the population is not a good idea, no matter what the issue is
But hey at least our stocks are doing great
But hey neither matters because we got BETOOOOOOO 2020 babyyyy
But hey you gotta do it for the lolz
But hey you gotta do it for the lolz
bUt HiPaA
But his answer is completely irrelevant, hence the trolololo
But holy cow
But hopefully baddies who hate Russia and Iran more than they hate Israel and the US, and who also will prevent another ISIS 
But how...
But I admit the same as you Jeff I don't follow CFB more than what ESPN shoves in my fave
But I also didn't think trump was going to be president, so maybe you all should be panicking...
But I also guessed the Browns would favor the best edge rusher over the best DB so hey
But I also hate that Round 1 and 2 are basically unwatchable 
But I appreciate that you think it’s that clever
But I can completely see the debt forgiveness position: "I have debt, and I want to not have debt with minimal effort"
But I can jack it standing, sitting, lying down, upside down leg behind the head.. All are enjoyable
But I can’t really figure out why
But I can’t think of an easy way to both allow the players to make money and not also ruin college sports
But I cannot think of the last time ballistic missiles were used by a state against another state.
But i do buy that argument
But I do like the parts when it goes from dark to upbeat seamlessly
But I don’t know if it “stimulated” the economy. It’s tough to measure what that even means
But I don’t think any team that isn’t an absolute powerhouse is “fraudulent”
But I don’t think you’re gonna change his behavior 
But I don't actually care much. This is such a minor issue it's not even really worth discussing
But I feel like being a social media star is more about the recognition and free stuff, not actually making money.  Basically what john said
But I get them on IG not FB
But I have lost 12 pounds in about 5 weeks including the trip so that is rather fast
But I have work at 9 tm so gnight BEAT LA
But I know he loves the AZ area and also loves hitting in that park
But I know you can take lump sum vs annuity
But I like that SecDef guy so it counterbalances it a bit
But I like your version too
But I made the offer to multiple parties. By definition that's not collusion
But I mean if this long term plan works and somehow BC becomes a perennial top 25 team in 40 years, then the plan will undoubtedly be a success. People will pay attention if/when we they winning
But I ordered via phone, not in a retail store
But I remember when he died it was a huge deal 
But I still am frustrated by the incessant ball above/below feet shots on the front 9
But i still appreciate the high effort photoshops 
But I think it makes sense
But I totally forgot about being snubbed for that award lol thanks Emyr 
But I unfortunately watched Rough and Rowdy last weekend so I mentioned that too since it was relevant
But I was told abortion would be illegal by now 🤔 
But I will exchange info for your conversation with becker last night 🤔 
But I will hear an argument against space jam
But I will rise from the ashes stronger than ever
But I’d expect most bases do the same or very similar
But I’ll fake interest if you want
But I’m 2-8 in betting through 2 weeks so maybe idk what the fuck I’m talking about
But I’m frequently down to play weekday pm 9s in the summer 
But I’m going to wait and see rather than preemptively rage over what could be much ado about nothing
But I’m gonna be mad about it
But I’m on the record #inhere of saying we should’ve gotten Kirk in 2017
But I’m thinking Saturday night more as a “let’s go out, invite anybody you want, leave whenever you want” sorta thing
But I'd bet closer to 1 than 2
but i'd bet that he is the starter of a majority of games ROS
But idk if that’s close to right
But idk tho (in case this comes back to bite me)
But if betting on Kirk is wrong, I don’t wanna be right 
But if cooper Kupp puts up 180 points and he’s got a shot
But if every student snuck their phone in, it would be ok 🤔
But if he finishes and doesn’t rerun, you win
But if I did, it would 100% be about fantasy football
But if I find a girl to go with me you're all being put on the backburner
But if I’m sitting will fuller and DJ Moore every week while scrounging the waivers for an RB2, that’s a losing strategy.
But if Palestine was able to 1) stop violence and 2) economically succeed, that would be my top priority as the “realist” Palestinian leader
But if she looking for basic betch but fun: Penny farthing, phebes, bar none, professor Thoms are all in that area
But if the backup gets hurt and they play again, that’s not a “benched for the season”
But if there are lots of people in the pool I’m prob not gonna just let it loose
But if there was a proposal to cap doctors salaries at $100K, you'd be upset
But if this take is “21 is too young to be hot” then yeah that is just wrong
But if you can get around it then it’s a dumb rule
But if you can't spend $800 million anyway, why would you ever invest it?
"But if you cash out and he doesn’t win, it’s a double win. 

Double down (by cashing out) coward. This is a no hedge zone. "
But if you told me Toney finishes last, I wouldn’t be surprised either
But if you went to Santa Cruz and Monterrey for a day or two then it would be worth it
But if you were a bulls fan or teammate, you'd certainly care
But if you win the lottery, it's prob pretty easy to get a loan lol
But if you’re an As fan who’s been loyal for years and now switches, you can certainly say you’ve dealt with the hard times
But If you’ve ever built one of these, you’d understand 
But I'll say it's almost impossible for a player to perform well individually and yet also hurt his team. It's very possible to do that in football and especially basketball
But I'm all for adding caveats
but im happy enough to just be right
But I'm not doing shit at work last week or this week so please keep me busy with GroupMe 
But in 2012 we lost the opener and the haters counted us out then we won the World Series 
But in a more surprising twist, they want Bama (who they hate) to win to prove the SEC is the best
But in all seriousness I favor tinkering with values over keeper limit. Most teams had 3 or fewer keepers this season anyway and the draft pool was barren. And guys like Bell and OBJ would still be keepers for 2/3 more seasons.
But in modern English, just use "who" every time
But in objectivity positive news, the dodgers GM just gave them the finger and is heading to the San Francisco Giants 
But isn't it common for markets to have a false upswing, then tank harder?
But isn't the first part of your point that people do it naturally and automatically because it's so efficient?
but it didnt send, ruining the whole joke
But it is easier to piss on your zipper or something. 
But it made sense when we were trading fantasy players right?
But it should be noted that this only pertains to the Russia collusion story, not the other scandals like hush money payments, trump foundation slush fund, etc 
But it was tattooed across his chest lol
But it will take a lot to regain the locker room and Russ has shown zero evidence that he’s able to do so
But it would obviously be more offense and higher scores. It would also change the strategies behind both pitching and hitting, and baserunning too I suppose. But that's not necessarily a downside other than "you can't change baseball". 
But it’s been good. Lifes pretty easy. Class all day, live in a dorm -equivalent. So basically freshmen year except everybody’s in uniform and it’s 75% dudes. I find out my next assignment on July 11
But it’s not good news that the biggest name fresh faces are Harris, Beto, and Warren. Klobuchar and gillibrand are interesting but need to elevate their national profiles (the big media players could be hugely influential here).
But it’s ok I’m still cherishing when you said I would’ve been a net positive at your Bach party
But it’s still easily group 3
But it’s telling you thought I was talking about you 🤔 
But it’s voluntary. More like fat camp IMO. 
but its a good article that is long overdue for recognition from the left
But it's not too late! You can all still register to vote republican and vote for Rubio in the primary and do your part to stop Trump!
But it's probably just a dramatic quote. Dudes kind of a drama queen
But it's still unconfirmed. Prob 65% chance right now 
But I've accepted non PPR and no kickers so let's drop it. Looking forward to the draft
But I've also said about 4 words to Maggie in my life so it's okay
But Jeff the French have great cheese...
But Jefferson literally stepped on Durants foot and clearly pushed him. I'm for favoring non-call over a call, but that was ridiculous. 
But John this bad boy is more your style
But Klob isn’t liberal enough so you get crickets from the woke crew
But Lebron with the step over is fine. As is his lobbying for the suspension. And the constant whining about how the cards are always stacked against him. And complaining about the fouls. And the finger pointing to the refs on every play 
But like if there's 2 girls, a 6 and 7 and you can't tell their hair color. Then the reveal of the hair color really changes the score?
But like the model said Klobuchar had a 0.5% chance like 2 days ago. That’s way too low
But like there’s no better test
But man ESPN managed to piss off everyone with this whole fiasco. What terrible management
But man the NFC is way better
But man those cops were so outnumbered. And lol @ the rioters who pushed down the female cop then went to help her up 
But Mitch is prob gonna get benched and so we had a 4 game minimum starts, but now Lock got hurt and it’s becoming it’s more trouble than it’s worth
But more important than the actual place, who is around? 
But more importantly the Ners extended kittle for $75/5 so incredible deal for the team
But more importantly, I hit 2 dingers last night, improving my squadrons morale and therefore directly contributing to the Air Force Mission
But more importantly, where is the rest of the groupme for the pee poll?
But more likely is that those well educated people live in more liberal areas, and Cruz' whole base is evangelical Christians
But most positions this administration takes are retarded so I’m not surprised
But my team is buns so that's the bigger problem
But no
But no excuse. I’m sucking hard
But no I have no idea what he did wrong and I too would like to know
But no it wasn't them of course
But no, we are not friends
But nobody knows anything yet so anybody saying that now is retarded
But not as stupid as the guy who paid $75 for Cooper Kupp in another of my leagues
but not in scorscese movies
But not like John wall who tries to avg more points than his team will get wins
But not the broncos? And you also hate the Texans and the Colts
But odds of a deal getting done are still >50% IMP
But ok
But once judge (and nimmo sorta) we’re gone we didn’t have much of a choice
But once Nomar left the Sox, his career flatlined... suggesting that perhaps Nomar + Boston is a Hall of Fame level talent, but Nomar + LA is not
But our president is a narcissistic, arrogant, selfish, thin skinned moron. So yeah.  
But overall I agree with Goody that it's a stupid issue that affects like .0001% of the population
But overall, I'm totally for TPP and creating a partnership that isolates China
But players were saying they didn’t want any dip in salary at all, and the owners are offering LESS than prorated 
But please continue your Browns clan conversation. It was quite juicy before Jeff ruined it
But Ray doesn't even do that. He says the dumbest shit before and after the games "They want it more". "They were better at the line of scrimmage". I like when people (like Gruden) look at actual plays and show designed decoys, QB decision trees, etc. 
But re: warriors, Draymond and Bogut are not-so-hidden reasons for the Warriors' success. Draymond in that he can pass like a PG, shoot well, and guard small and big men. Bogut in that he can pass and he's annoying as fuck to post up and box out because he uses his hips so well. The rest of the guys have learned first hand how to expand their skill sets, and it's really not that hard when the starters show you how it's done every night. Of course it's possible that the team goes cold on the shot and loses a series, giving Churls Burkluy the biggest boner ever, but that happened for 2 games against CLE before they regained their stroke and dominated. That combined with a high turnover rate, which they have demonstrated they are prone to, could pose trouble. Still, they're confident as hell and it would take a more than a few bad games to rock them out of their groove. 
But realistically yeah I'd fire that fucker so fast. Regarding the whole negative publicity deal, I think any publicity would be good publicity and it's not that hard to spin this into a positive (or at least non-negative) story. Biggest downside would probably be other employees being upset if he is fired, if he's liked by them
But saying they should’ve taken fields is not just hindsight either
But seriously Ted Williams... Hit >300 every single year (but one) with some serious power, and hit >400 for 3 seasons. OPS >1.000 every year but one. AND he skipped his 24-26 year old years to serve in the military. First year back he hits .342 with 38! homers and wins MVP
But seriously would pay to see a group of crotchety old white guys who are both golf addicts and trump supporters react to that video. The cognitive dissonance might give them all strokes
But seriously... of all the hills to die on...
But Shanny can beat a top 10 team  with literal Mr Irrelevant at the helm 
But she was fun junior and senior year?
But she’s not bad either 
But she's not even funny!! If you're gonna do that at least be FUNNY!
But short answer: yes. Also that he had several terrible seasons with SF before harbaugh, even if they weren't his fault
But small sample size
But so do a lot of teams ngl
But so far not great for the Democrats 
But sometimes those decisions make my friend $500 so that’s nice
But still exceeded expectations sorta 
But still gonna say most individual of the team sports simply due to the fact that hitting is almost completely an individual effort. Fielding is for the most part too. 
But still id bet that practicing and implementing pre snap motion as much as possible is a net benefit to the offense 
But still including all of those people, 99% of terrorists are still Muslim
But still no BC policy infuriated me more than the pay a fine to get out of disciplinary-related community service
But still the fact that some ass voted cole Beasley while AJB, Thielen, Keenan Allen, Mike Evans, Allen Robinson, etc got zero votes is a joke
bUt TcU oNlY lOsT bY 70 pOiNtS
But that could very well just be pro-Hillary propaganda 
But that doesn’t meat I don’t want you to set me up with someone when I come around @Boe Jourque @2020 Champion 
But that doesn't make any sense?!
But that gif can make me overlook it
But that might be because the whole comedy genre is dead
But that other one is good too
But that still doesn't make sense. That gives the hospital the leeway to charge anything for anything. Why wouldn't they do that?
But that was more in the lungs. This mucus shit is all in the throat
But that’s 95% a bluff right?
But that's a lot of my Obama hate coming through. In truth, there's really not much he ever could've done. I just wish he didn't fucking flex so hard and then back down with a whimper
But that's a separate conversation...
But that's def really close
But that's not optimal right, so say you start from 1/4. If it breaks you start from one, if it doesn't you drop from half and repeat. Then 3/4. 
But that's taking the cheap way anywaynhaha
But That's why I think the theory is weakened by this year. Hillary is clearly the Dem party elite choice, but 45-50% of Dem voters support Bernie 
But the above list is my guesses, aligned with the aliases in alphabetical order
But the biggest increase comes from Housing allowance which is based on area. It almost triples moving from the gordo to DC
But the concept Marcus 
But the confidence to post videos of yourself getting repeatedly burned 1 on 1 and often falling over spectacularly... That is just amazing
But the consumer hits his max on his insurance and it doesn't matter who gives treatment at that point...
BuT tHe DePt oF dEfEnSe
But the drop 8 on D every play and having CMC play CB? Good thing the black QB is… Lamar Jackson.
But the general rule is no TV, radio, magazines, etc
But the ISP has to provide the same bandwidth to Netflix vs an esoteric website right? 
But the majority of my political news comes from Twitter, tbh. Following lots of pundits and writers is better for 24/7 coverage
But the mask one is all time. He would be proud
But the Native American dude clearly started it then played victim so that’s pretty lame-o
But the overall point is fair
But the real problem with that kind of thinking is that it paints political opponents as either 1) willfully ignorant, or 2) evil
But the Republican won down ballot!
But the secret Santa part isn’t really the point anyway
But the startup cost for a single uber driver is minimal, right? No barriers to entry?
But then I fucked the kid up at league championships so that was redeeming
But then she got boring as hell. She needs to hammer that home. 
But then they countered with an outflanking maneuver, refusing to give you a regular bun. So Team Kelleher counter-countered: get only 2 cheeses on the large meat, so when they put the bread on, they see the 2 cheeses and think it’s a regular
But then you quit and let all the people down. You singlehandedly crushed the hopes and dreams of all the people who you champion for
BUT THEN YOU STILL HAVE $750 MILLION
But there are too many patients and not enough doctors so that does the opposite to help the problem. The issue is untreated patients, not med school students unable to find residencies
But theres a section of Azerbaijan that is like 99% Armenian, but the lines were drawn that way by the USSR. armenia claims it as Armenian and occupies the territory militarily. There have been flare ups here and there since the collapse of the USSR, including a big one like a month ago. Now it’s getting worse. Also Russia supports Armenia and Turkey supports Azerbaijan 
But they often run out of time so that skews things a bit
But they went to different schools, you wouldn't know them
But they're soft wieners, nice and soft, not erect, wieners
But things are looking up!
But think of the juiciness that were all in the league and not Bock boi 
But this bitmoji shit is gay as fuck
But this is literally the plot to this game
But this particular war game is really simple from that perspective and barely accounts for red realism, only that they’re gonna kill everything they can. 
But this would also be robbery
But those are also all major cities. Oakland was kind of the exception. Maybe Baltimore DC is the closest equivalent
But urban Meyer getting fired by week 8 is gonna be hilarious 
But we got to see the base of his wiener so great day no matter what happens
But we’re ok with Danny Dimes getting $160/4 lol
But what about her emails
But what does any of that solve?
But what has trump done that’s so norm breaking?!
But what I mainly meant was rent, and suppose general subsidies. Technically all money can just be rerouted lol 
But what I missed is the why: the Russian MOD decided, implicitly with putins support, that Wagner would dissolve and be assimilated into the Russian military. Prigozhin saw this as the end of his influence and was willing to “risk it all” to keep that. It appears he failed, at least in the short term
But what if another Kenyan socialist Muslim who literally created ISIS is elected president. The constitution says that is NOT okay
But what if that person is only compelled to give it for money?
But what is the definition of a catch?
But what is the PV vs FV
But what we have now is far more than the liberal project of integrating minorities. It comes close to an attack on the liberal project itself. Marxism with a patina of liberalism on top is still Marxism — and it’s as hostile to the idea of a free society as white nationalism is. So if you wonder why our discourse is now so freighted with fear, why so many choose silence as the path of least resistance, or why the core concepts of a liberal society — the individual’s uniqueness, the primacy of reason, the protection of due process, an objective truth — are so besieged, this is one of the reasons
But who actually is this girl
But why do crutches cost $900?
But Wikipedia says no it’s mostly Indians. As I was. 
But with practice, I would take the corner 3. Heck with enough practice, I’d probably be able to make the Olympics in track
But would somebody really pay $100MM to Mayweather for that?? I don’t think he’d fight for any less
But would you take 5:2 on pats over 10 wins?
But wouldn’t it mean that my capital gains income from 2014-2017 would be tax free?
But WoW, LoL, CS gotta be biggest worldwide
But wtf was that play call on the last 2 possessions
but yeah "associate with those years" is more what i was going for
But yeah as goody said many NBA fans follow players, not teams. Lebron is the easiest but best example, nobody who is a Lebron fan likes the Heat anymore
But yeah Becker the reason for the coops is to offer the same insurance plans that Aetna, Blue Cross, etc offer, except be non-profit. However, since the overwhelming majority of coop patients are über high risk, they're losing money like crazy. 
But yeah Cowgirl if they’re great at it
But yeah he became a coach at a bottom-team in a top tier league in Seattle, immediately recruited a bunch of transfers, and now they're undefeated and the #1 team in the country, beating Oak Hill and a bunch of other top schools
But yeah he’s 20-25 so it is ordered right, just a bad cell which demonstrates pitiful excel skills 
But yeah he's strong as fuck and he has next level confidence, which I envy in a way
But yeah how bout that Streissand Effect with the silencing by the GOP clowns?
But yeah I agree it probably didn't change anything
But yeah I usually do reddit, 538, and SBNation. And I need to change it up. I can’t have my phone so IG and whatever is out of the question 
But yeah I would love to see an A gap blitzer push the G outside, then letting a DE stunt and come through the middle  
But yeah I would totally be a customer. If I could listen to who I wanted instead of whatever cardboard cutout is broadcasting that would be great
But yeah I’m not broken up about it at all. Thanks for the condolences anyway
But yeah if Trump was colluding with Russia to attack the Democrats... that would be big to ME. Not sure if elected republicans would care
But yeah I'm increasingly less convinced that democracy is a long term solution for a large and diverse country... I'm trying to believe but evidence is pointing against it
But yeah I'm telling you national polls don't mean shit (yet); in fact they're counterproductive until after Iowa and NH
But yeah I'm very sad about Rubio. Really thought he had a chance, but he was never able to break the ceiling of "everybody's second choice"
But yeah it appears there is no shortage of competitors existing. I still think it may have a place though
But yeah it is possible he’s semi mailing it in...
But yeah Jeff it makes total sense why they're the best every year. No incentive for a HS player to go anywhere else really. It's just boring as hell. 
But yeah Jeff that’s basically right 
But yeah kings have been a dysfunctional organization for the past 5 plus years. I think they've had a new coach every year, never even had a shot at success... so it's almost like he believes he has no reason to care. Certainly wouldn't call him mature, but I think his craziness is far overblown
"But yeah my biggest takeaways from this clusterfuck of a primary are:
1) Approx 35% of both Reps and Dems are extremists.
2) Voters are more myopic than I ever expected. 
3) The voters don't care what the party thinks any more."
But yeah my strongest wouldn't even make Darrow's B team...
But yeah not a bad speech actually. I'll be surprised if it lasts, but probably the high point of the trump presidency so far
But yeah offer stands to anybody, if you actually want a referral I can give you one and send a resume along.
But yeah people overhype it like they overhype everything. It's a burger
But yeah she was the face of peaceful resistance to a military junta for like 15 years, and she won and became president. So hailed as like a modern day Nelson Mandela or equivalent. Then she may have enabled some minor ethnic cleansing...
But yeah that's a real good trivia question. The GOAT, a hilarious failure, and two journeymen
But yeah that's lower than I paid for NYC basketball, fwiw
But yeah the larger point stands
But yeah the other 3 were within 5 seconds 
But yeah things continue to look worse and worse for Don. Cohen and manafort are going to prison, people keep on flipping against him, and “individual 1” is almost certainly being probed for criminal activity. Mueller also wrote that the hush money payments to stormy and that other girl were directed by Don. Also believable speculation that kushner and/or Don Jr are going to be indicted soon. 
But yeah this Cash Rewards card looks good
But yeah this is probably fair at this point haha
But yeah, 1 steal is worth 9 points in terms of evaluating a players worth. 
But yes I can point to it on a map
But yes if you sold your soul for $10, I’d pay up
But yes they’re not loading for me
But yes, I think the general concerns is is that Djokovic and the modern guys do rival Sampras and Agassi, if not surpass them
But yes, on the bill, crutches were $900
But yes, Rubio (or anyone really) could be the nominee from the RNC. Suspending your campaign is exactly what it sounds like and nothing more; he still has bound delegates. There are very complex rules about which delegates can switch to who at what times. And Paul Ryan is actually being beckoned to allow himself to be considered, but has thus refused. That all being said, Rubios actual chances of being nominated are close to zero. His opinion however could be massively influential. 
But yes, you'd be fucked for the rest of the Sunday. But if you have no backup plan at that time then "be better and handcuff bro"
But yo I posted a video in here called “kickoffs are stupid and bad” that said  they are higher injury risk, 75% are touchbacks anyway, and the expected points added is negligible between the 20 and 30 anyway
But you admitted you don't pay attention posts that don't concern you, re: the SAT punishment
But you can cop out if you want. It’s not a test lol
But you can't get a degree in one year
But you do admit that future value was required to balance the trade
But you don't actually have to calculate anything, right?
But you got us all so good job 👏🏼 
But you have to call the pitch. Like I’m only swinging if it’s a belt high breaking ball
But you have to pay at least $1 for that option?
But you need the logo to differentiate between badass tigers and brown people
But you said you went to a Ross store for the first time in years like 3 weeks ago
But you shouldn't quit. That'd be gay. 
But you still do live in a fantasy world, you just don't have a say in what happens anymore
But you’re not gonna ask that mid sex
But your party is better so nobody is mad we just like complaining
But your prescriptions should all be free
But your stalker ass knows that
But youre talking like him tho
But, as Chans chart points out, it's more about the aggregate endorsements, not individual ones. There are only a few individual ones that really matter, like George W Bush
But, it’s also totally possible that it actually didn’t play a big factor at the end of the day
BUT, outside of Miami dade, Biden looks to be doing ok, which may translate better for him outside of that weird demographic area
But, she was also a solid 9 so that was cool
But, the IAF is very good at minimizing collateral damage. So my money is the Palestinian civilians killed are either 1) assessed hostile by the IAF, or 2) actual civilians killed by Hamas rocket misfires, which has happened a lot in the past
Buttfuckery is a great word
Butthole Caleb looks really good smh
Butthole has 6 targets and 1 catch for 9 yards. Including a would be TD that hit him in the face 
Butthole tankie never accepted my follow request. Buddy won’t even share the free #content with the masses, how’s he gonna share material wealth 🤔 
Buy in is $5?
Buy in shouldn’t change. I’m a fan of last place punishment but that ship has sailed
Buy your own router and make sure it can output what you need tho
Buying at the top?
Buzz Aldrin signed something NASA-ey, made a "To Infinity and Beyond Joke". That was Trumps response 
BUZZFEED CARES DAMMIT!! And if you dont, you're part of the problem!!
By 2032, there will be the CFB league and the NCAA for all the rest
By all I mean Derozan, Beal, and Batum. Rats I wanted Batum on the Warriors 
By all present

By far
By gluing their asscheeks to the glass that overlooks the MPs 
By individual team subs, GSW, LAL, Boston, Toronto (!), Philly, Chicago are the biggest, only ones over 40k. GS is only one over 100k. 
By Megan Trainor
By my fucking self because I have no friends 
By rich do you mean able to afford more than a $25 league buy in?
By sketchy I mean he was paid a lot to do apparently nothing. Not like criminal activity
By the “did he catch the fucking ball” backyard rule, it was a catch
By these rules you're right, iso 1v1 every play because why the fuck not?
By your definition, that's significantly better than solid
Bye. I had an Interesting conversation a few days ago about Public healthcare with a few nurse OTs and former firefighters, who are extremely anti big welfare state because their own experiences about people abusing the system have jaded them so badly. 2 firefighters say that 90% of their time is spent on calls that are complete wastes of time, spending millions of taxpayer dollars, but obviously they are legally required to respond to with utmost priority. Perspective I Hadn’t heard before

Caitlin Clark is still there 🤔 
Cal beat the allegations at last weeks gameday 
Cal Ripken Sr?
Calais Campbell got 1st team DE and 2nd team DT. I think I’d rather just give it to someone else and let them get their contract bonus
Calculating probability from odds for underdogs is simply (100/100+odds)
Caleb is NFL Joel Embiid
"Caleb not being named FLB 5 is like when scientists announced dinosaurs had feathers.

Call me crazy but sometimes I think Marcus just trolls and we fall for it every time
Call me crazy but the flag QB might actually have a better understanding of flag than Mahomes 
Call me lemon peppering but I swear half the GMs don’t know shit either. Stuff like Zeke’s contract, or Saquon #2 overall, or the Jamal Adams trade, or Ian Thomas new $16.5/3 deal… It feels like Moneyball where these moves are just archaic and just because we’re not football guys doesn’t mean we’re wrong to criticize them. 
Call me paranoid but I’m not trying to tell google what my face looks like
Call me when KAT does anything even close to this
Call option or put option? And what's the cost of the option?
Call them extra OTs idc
Called it

Calling CNN bullshit on that one. Rubio is outperforming his polls everywhere. He is not doing great, but he is still in a much better position to win delegate-wise than Cruz is.

Cam Newton puts the team on his back
Cam Smith was just unreal
Cam, Von Miller, Justin Houston, Patrick Peterson, AJ Green
Cam? Fitzmagic? Andy Dalton? Mitch?!
Came in as the surefire alt to trump. Big electoral success history. Lots of marketable wins as gov of Florida, popular with educated Rep bloc. Then ran a Directionless campaign that was super cringey and online, exposed himself as a super awkward weirdo, and opened the way for Haley to be neck and neck with him.
Cams season has been super cold then super hot. Dude can't decide if he's an MVP or an overrated bum

Can't say I've heard of the jabbawockeez 
Can't say that in your other groupme. Vinny would be really upset
Cant see the full messages since they're unexpanded but I'm assuming he's saying you'd have to pay tax on the free Acura you won. Not really sure what he's getting at with the second point

Capitalism and democracy
Capitalism and free trade are the reasons everybody in America can buy a smartphone 
Capitalism has resulted in a the most drastic decrease in poverty in the history of the world. Socialism has resulted in increased poverty literally every single time. The only time these semi-socialized systems have worked ever are in modern small white countries with low poverty rates, like all the countries you named or a state like Massachusetts. It doesn't work in countries with large and poor demographics as proven time and time again. I'm not saying there should be no welfare state, but giving more and more to welfare by form of central planning has literally never benefited a society ever. We're literally watching it in Venezuela now. It's staggering that this has to be pointed out
Capitalism is undefeated
Capitalism is undefeated
Capitalism is undefeated 
Capitalism remains undefeated 
Capitalism wins again
Capitals are NY/Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/Austin, SF/LA

Careful marcus. Even the best fantasy players of all time can get unlucky
Careful, might get Marcus in here saying WWII was a bad idea 
Careful, might upset the Pats Stans by suggesting any other player/team in the league is good

Carlos Correa: “What doesn’t sit well with me is when you say false statements. If you don’t know the facts or you’re not informed – this is America, Ken [Rosenthal], you can say whatever you want, but Cody Bellinger’s job is to look for information, get informed, and know the facts for sure before he stands in front of cameras to talk about other players. You should be informed and get informed before you talk about other players. If you don’t know the facts then you got to shut the f*ck up.”

Constantly refer to Brady preferring them deflated, even getting signed Brady stuff to acquiesce his requests. Lots of jokes about Brady being a whiner and over inflating the ball to piss him off

Considering how Cruz and Trump are leading, and Carson and even Fiorina got some traction early on, I'd say the outsiders are pretty much set. An establishment candidate late entry is possible (Romney I suppose or maybe Paul Ryan), but I doubt either has special appeal that Rubio doesn't.
Considering it’s possibly the most disappointing movie I’ve ever seen, I’m gonna say no
Considering it’s usually QB on the best team
Considering Singletarys coaching strategy was to scream at them to play harder, I think Davis is going to be pleasantly surprised by having Peyton as his new coach

"Consulting firm Accenture PLC predicted last year that one of the 2,000 largest companies in the world will have “no full-time employees outside of the C-suite” within 10 years.

Accenture is one of the world’s largest providers of outsourced labor. Along with many rivals, it is pitching chief executives on the idea that their company’s core business is smaller than they think.

“We’ve shown we can do core parts of their business better than they can do it themselves,” says Mike Salvino, who ran Accenture’s outsourcing business for seven years until he left in 2016."

Conventional wisdom seems to be that Browns are taking a QB at 1, Giants taking Barkley or an OL at 2. So the Jets should have at worst their 2nd pick of QB at 3. Then Browns could take Barkley at 4 if available. And clearly the Colts are banking on Luck returning and returning well.

Correct, holds the classified info where we have class

Could be 4th of July? Depending on the holiday schedule
Could be a DK metcalf comp
Could be a public sector job run at the county or state level, funded by taxpayers. Additionally keep the private PCPs we have today.
Could be BS, but I like the story 
Could be over a season. Highest points for/against ratio gets to date rape the lowest
Could be released as soon as this weekend
Could be spotlight bias but it seems like these defense oriented teams are rarely highly successful for more than a season. Broncos, Panthers, Giants, etc. Suppose Seattle breaks the mold but they've had lots of offensive life too.
Could be working toward that now instead of spending all his time on hinge smh
Could definitely be cool for more off-the-radar vacation spots, but those would be tougher to review without doing them yourself, incurring quite an expense...
Could fucking use one
Could just be they think they can’t win with him no matter what and would rather roll dice on an unknown
Could just limit 1 buyback per customer
Could not endorse more
Could not have forgotten harder
Could not stand harder
Could use a day off
Could use a kind southern woman to invite me in for pancakes
Could use a kind southern woman’s son to invite me in for dinner
Could/should turn around but putting up 2 FGs in a half against a bottom 3 defense in the league is awful
Could’ve been us but all y’all buttheads had to go get married and shit. Shoutout out to Darrow Joe Chan and me for keeping the bros before hoes
Could’ve just said “all ivs are terrible”
Could’ve just said Offense
Could’ve just texted Dr Lt Kelleher instead of listening to Biden 
Could’ve just used Gregor Mendel smh
Could’ve traded for Trey Lance
Could’ve used some branding help tho
Coulda finished it off. But ran out of stamina
Couldn’t be he was only 4 years in the league
Couldn’t be me. Now a shovelful of snow being tossed in my living room? That’s another story
Couldn’t that argument be made about bad food or alcohol or anything bad?
Couldn’t. Be. Me.
Couldn't be iverson that's Reebok
Couldn't dizrespeck any of the other 🐐s
Couldn't wait for you clowns, I did it myself
Couldn't watch the game, but apparently we won?! Anybody wanna Tldw for me? 
Couldn't you say that about Paul george then too?
Could've been a legit protest vote. Shame. 
Could've used you on the call goodwin
Counterpoint, if it’s a fed holiday, people will use the day for a vacation and won’t actually use it to vote. Anybody who cares about voting will find a way anyway

Curry is a wizard but Lebron is #good
Curry is amazing 
Curry, Draymond, Thompson, Duncan, Ginobili, Parker, Aldridge, Leonard. It's possible that ALL 8 of these guys are future Hall of Famers.
Currys skill has been discounted his whole career (and I'm not guiltless of it either). For 2 years it was a question if he was better than Monta. Then it was a question if he was a starter. Then it was a question if he's an all star. Then it's a question if he's considered in the same realm as Lebron / KD / etc. Then it's the question if he's better than them. Now it's the question: is he the best offensive player of all time. 
Curryyyyyyy because he's the beeeeeeeest and also his wife is the anti Kim Kardashian and he's like the only athlete left on the planet who is basically unhatable, so he's the 🐐

Dam soLakers are currently over the cap by $2MM. Of movable pieces, Deng makes $18MM, Randle and KCP $12. Obviously they want to move Deng but would prob need to give up a fair amount to do so. And even if they do, they’ll need to prob also trade one of those 2 to get space to sign Boogie/Kawhi. It looks pretty rough if they do that this year, and waiting a year for Kawhi seems like a legit option at this point.

Damn you know I’m down bad when Darrow is chirping me about golf
Damn you should start asking your patients for a tip
Damn you’re right I should’ve posted from Thread
Damn Zona get your shit together
Damn!
Damn, Brady was hit 20 times, which is the most QB hits of any single game this season
Damn, check this quote from Trump's co-author of The Art of the Deal
Damn, if you make $32,400 / year, you're in the top 1% of the world. And the world today is richer than ever.
Damn, nothing BC football needs less than an extremely expensive and highly publicized marketing gimmick to fail catastrophically... Hopefully it's at least fun for the players
Damn, turns out that Muslims aren't the only organized terrorists in the world...
Damn. In the health deep 
Damn. In the health department 
Damn. Ngl “BC is probably gonna go 8-4 at worst” is a wild thing to put money on. I respect it though ✊🏼 
Damn. Ruling made just like that.

DanLOL Jones 
Danny dimes 
Danny Luna was a black kid from the Bronx, one of those "idk how you got into BC" kids. Not an athlete either. Dude hates Gordon, challenges him to 1v1 publicly. A crowd gathers to watch the showdown. Danny Luna, fresh off his 8th blunt of the day, straight embarrasses Gordon. Gordon is furious and I think this directly led to one of the fights 
Danny McBride as Kenny Powers
Danny proceeds to give anesto the rock to start, of course that lil graveler ass mother fucker can't do shit with it so Danny gets the ball. This will be the last time anesto touches the ball as the game proceeds to end 10-0. Yes they did not make it to 11 because he ended up getting so upset about being such a jackalope that he went full hulk ripped off his shirt (one of his best moves but only has 5 PP so he has to use it wisely) and tried to fight
Darby is getting burned
Dare Dorm
Dare I say that was a pretty genuine winner run right there
Dare I suggest he would rather rebuff the deal fulfillment in order to make accusations, instead of simply accepting payment? 🤔
Darius Wade was supposed to be a gem of a recruit but obviously he couldn't prove it
Dark + Camo made you impossible to detect while in stealth mode. Could literally walk in circles around the enemy and stab him 
Darnell’s ankles savagely broken
Darnold > Lamar?
Darnold is still on his rookie contract, rivers and Brissett are both expiring this year and their cost is sunk. It’s not crazy.
Darnolds made a serious step back under QB whisperer Gase
Darrel Williams is a scrub and is losing me money
Darren Sharper probably rounds out my top 5
Darrow = Hillary, Becker = Trump, Joe = Rubio

Darrow I laughed out loud
Darrow if you actually wanna know, this shit simultaneously makes my blood boil and fascinates me.
Darrow if you can start saying "leverage" instead of "use", "bandwidth" instead of "free time", and say "sorry can you repeat that?" when you hear your name on a conference call, then you're already 80% of the way there
Darrow I'm gonna give you a retry there
Darrow is commish. He gets to decide 
Darrow is facial hair top of the power rankings by a long shot 
Darrow is the hottest fuckhole by a mile
Darrow is the staircase. Reliable, sturdy, doesn’t ever break down, builds strong legs.
Darrow is up 90 going into this week
Darrow Joe tells me you have a story involving Steven Wu, snapchat, and feces?
Darrow learn how to make eye contact, then sheepishly smile and look away, then when she says “what?” Say “nothing, you’re pretty, that’s all”. Kid would literally bang so many girls  
Darrow looking so darrow in this pic
Darrow looks so happy

Darrow vs Marcus would be good
Darrow wins
Darrow you and me are in a tight one 
Darrow you could create your own gym shorts company
Darrow you got fleeced 
Darrow you misspelled Jeff
Darrow you're boxing Joe, this has been established
Darrow you're not going to the Q center are you
Darrow, A+
Darrow, our matchup is crazy
Darrow, you're now in charge of finding TWO replacements for the league next year. Damn shame...
Darrow:

Joe: Apple pie

Becker: Creme Brûlée
John: Rasmalai
Jeff: Blueberry lavender ice cream

Darrowball is Kim Jong Il confirmed
Darrowball quit right the fuck now. Then Jeff has to quit, then I don't lose the Posa 
Darrowball vs Emyr is gonna be a hell of a battle. Might even rival Lance vs Red.

Decent article on 538 about historical splits in American political parties. Not as much data or conclusion as I generally like, but good at providing context for the current clusterfuck of the Republican Party (and under the radar the Democratic Party too)
Decent higher-level article on Trump's economic plans from an economist I respect:
Decent shot I’ll be in Central Texas then so that would be perfect
Decent shot. Possible he’s not liberal enough and too much of a cozy to evil big banks boi for the primary
Dechambeau is the man
Decided to roll over and take it. Not what you want to see.
Deciding between “this is literally what you signed up for” and “wow the AMA truly is a racket”
Decision making is the most important skill a QB can have and it’s basically impossible to qualify, not just for scouts but coaching staffs too
Declined

Defending Iran is probably not the hill to die on
Defense defense defense 
"Defense: “how can you argue your client suffered wrongful death when he’s literally testifying right now?”

Marcus: “ahem, well ACTUALLY…”"
Defensive game plan going forward has to be more focused on making Russ shoot and getting physical with KD. Tiring out and boxing out Adams and Ibaka will be key since they can't just outsize those guys. I'd also advocate changing up the pace a little more (i.e. settling for half court offense sometimes instead of fast breaking every single possession)
Defensive personnel are pretty different this year. Sure hope it holds up
Define "worked out". Everyone of these contracts knowingly overpays at the end to get value at the beginning.

Delegates are basically just electoral votes, but they're usually not winner take all. In Iowa, Cruz won 8 delegates. Trump and Rubio won 7
Delegates are the people you vote for to vote for you. So your congressional district has a delegate. Everybody in the CD votes, then the delegate puts in the official vote in the party convention. In theory, that delegate will vote for the person who got the majority of votes in the CD. 
Delegates is like the electoral college within a state

Dems could’ve nominated Lamb and likely won but they went with the worse option
"Dems in 2008: “Wow this guy Obama came out of nowhere and beat our anointed Hillary and then beat McCain! Pretty lucky, we should plan for when he’s done”

2016: “hmm sorta forgot about all that. Hillary again! No way that backfires! But we should probably find somebody for next time!”

2020: “hmm sorta forgot again. How about this lady Kamala! It almost worked sorta for Hillary! Biden is ok but we should probably have somebody prepped for after him, he’s really old”

2024: “ok actually he’s not old, don’t believe your lying eyes. We should probably have somebody prepped for next time tho”"

Depending on direction of wind I hit a 9 iron on a 115 and 185 yard shot
Depending on the track layout we could basically run 400s and sub for each other and it wouldn’t be close
Depending on when can people can take off, planning one right before/after Jeff’s wedding might be a great play
Depends 1) when you ask that question, and 2) what exactly you mean by “better”. 1) he hasn’t been expected to win since he tanked in IA and NH. 2) he did way better than he did in IA and NH
Depends how hard you throw em!
Depends how mad I when I’m riding my dragon over the city when the bells toll
Depends how well move in is going. Solid chance tho
Depends if you see your reflection in the snow covered hills

Depends on how damaging these missile strikes are. If it’s ineffective like in April, then deep breath and probably a hiatus. If it’s effective and destructive, we’re probably in for some serious shit. 
Depends on short game which I do not practice
Depends on the format. Assuming you're going nine categories. Yeah you wanna make sure you are set to compete in most if not all of them. Positional variability is very important. As is midweek waivers
Depends on the girl
Depends on the girlfriend for me. She’s 2 years younger so she might wanna wait more, if this thing actually goes the distance of course. 
Depends on the state, but yeah between 200-450 in terms of income
Depends on the WAR algorithm. I bet Fangraphs would have a slightly different order. 
Depends on traffic, but yes that's likely
Depends on what the next 200 years looks like. That’s a really long time. Who knows what countries even exist by then

Didn't have thanksgiving with her
Didnt he have just one season as a starting QB
Didn't he trade the Nets 2018 pick as part of the Kyrie deal?
Didn't hear about that and I don't know. I'd think a state would be glad to do it if the recount demanders are willing to pay for it.  
Didn't hear about the permission thing. I'm not sure what rumors are true and what's not. I've heard baalke was trying to ship him out against Kaps will, but I've also heard Kap wants to leave too. Either way the franchise is in shambles
Didn't it only become a lot more kid friendly in the past 10 or so years?
Didnt Jeff say he wanted to decrease the value of TDs
Didn't know that about the VP. But I don't buy the team not thinking it's an issue though. If I was a teammate who had a problem, I probably wouldn't want to tell Laroche himself since that might screw with chemistry. Instead I'd probably say something quietly to management
Didn't like it either. Very hit or miss

Didn't watch but followed the Comey hearing on twitter (and got yelled at by my boss to put my phone away). No bombshells that would make you salivate. Main takeaways are: Comey painted Trump as a liar; he fully believes he was fired over the Russia probe; Republicans are still sticking with trump at this point but also sort of acknowledging that comeys story is true and Trumps is full of holes
Didn't we also discuss increased cost per year kept?
Didn't we just win the World Cup?
Didn't you read the headline? It's not complicated.

Disagree with that assumption
Disagree with this. The Bills O was good, just had really bad turnovers. Which are obviously hugely impactful but also not particularly sticky in predictive power 
Disagree, I think you're overestimating that talent. Outside of the very best NCAA players, there wouldn't be a difference. The current D league teams would crush the best NCAA teams
Disagree, the NFL is way too hard to predict before game 1
Disagree. @Beanboy is more like the friendly neighborhood raccoon and @Jamie Bourque is your alcoholic but cool uncle

Disagree. 24 is likely a 4 score game, kicking was the right move
Disagree. Good decision, poor execution
Disagree. Hurts has had one good season
Disagree. I think natural ability matters in golf just as much as any sport
Disagree. Making major military moves without consulting the military is an impeachable offense
Disagree. One makes money, the other doesn't. Why not change the legal language to maximize business profits, if there is no negatively affected party?
Disagree. The actual conclusion was fine. The execution was botched worse than Theon’s of Ser Rodrick Cassel
Disagree. The marginal value of a dollar to these people is small, IMO

DNC Chair and top peeps actively planned to conspire against Bernie and work for Hillary. Wikileaks (Julian Assange) is the leaker, leaked the day before the DNC starts. DNC Chair resigned already. The tweet Joe shared is the (now former) DNC chair shitting on the RNC Chair.

Doesn't Becker live in Boston?
Doesn't even matter anyway. This is such horse shit it's unbelievable. The Jordy trade establishes future value is a legitimate bargaining chip. There is no collusion here. I'm trying only to make my team better. 
Doesn't have to be a long weekend. Can easily drive Friday, golf Saturday, return Sunday
Doesn't London have like 5 Premier league teams 
Doesn't look like it unfortunately. And it's possible this hype is all bullshit if Pop decides to bench all of his starters...
Doesn't matter I wasn't invited
Doesn't matter what the intention is, the implementation is all that matters. Same criticism as applied to Obamacare 
Doesn't matter, whichever move set you prefer
Doesn't Posa matchup start next week?
Doesn't say much coming from me, being a cynic on basically everything, but my expectations are low. I can imagine him being a Phil Jackson sort of guy who over-meddles and makes moves just to make them
Doesn't skyrim level with your character though? Like the stronger you are, the stronger your enemies are?
Doesn't talk foreign policy though :(
Doggies trivia was garbage
Doggo 
Dogs are good dogs 
Dogs. They already have humans trust, which is they key to their takeover. They all plot to continue to act stupid but be really easy to own, so more and more people own dogs. Then all at once they execute order 66 and take out humans in their sleep and wipe out like 80% of the population in developed countries. Then it's war, and the humans are way behind
Doing well on my prop bets, gonna lose the big $100
Dolphins and Lions. They seem to have all the pieces and yet still blow every year
Dolphins are absurdly Lucky
Dolphins are actually insane 
Dolphins are the definition of team you don’t wanna face in the playoffs

Dominoes is the best of the chain pizzas 
Dominos is actually great and also a top 5 restaurant in the gordo

Don’t forget they gave fat contracts to golden Tate and sterling Shepard, who play the same role
Don’t forget, fresh off the heels of “I get rock fucking hard when someone calls me Doctor”
Don’t get it, it’s not game over. They gained 40 yards for their defense on the punt. And even if it was, they’re down 2 scores. They have to take high variance chances to make a 2 score comeback on 1 quarter. 
Don’t get me wrong I love it most of the time but it’s the troof. I have to go now goodbye 
Don’t get me wrong, it’s a terrible post. But at least it has something to do with current developments in pro sports, which immediately puts it in the top quartile of SC posts
Don’t get my hopes up it’s never happening
Don’t hate it
Don’t have a “go to” but Northstar, Heavenly, Kirkwood, and Squaw are the highest quality. Alpine Meadows and Sugar Bowl are very good too.
Don’t have an end date yet but should be in NYC around first week of August, around Boston a week later. Prob gonna be one of those two
Don’t have data behind any of that on hand but all feel right to me
Don’t have numbers on this but I believe all sports leagues are doing better than ever with viewership, attendance, and income so not much reason to change
Don’t have time to distinguish between the drugs

Don’t know why that didn’t send earlier
Don’t like this bet. I know division is wide open but they have zero offensive weapons. Might as well bet Bryce Young OROY at better odds 
Don’t look now but we might’ve lost John too
Don’t need polyjuice potion to do that

DonLOLd trump 
Donnelly lost 👀 wonder if voting anti kavanaugh tanked him
Dons people seem kinda shady 
Don't be a partisan, acknowledge that your side is just as hypocritical and power hungry as the other. Focus on making your side better and not demonizing the other.
Don't bother. He doesn't return my calls or sexts 
Don't burn yourself out early, that's only thing I would say. First mile should be slower than your second, IMO

Dont know which pic I love more. Impossible to decide
Don't know who real rapist is... Probably never will
Don't know who's opening it. Prob some idiot Obama voter who actually believed his idea could sustain. And they didn't have any risk because the whole thing was bankrolled by taxpayer "loans"
Don't lie it was a treat to hear him sarinate you 
Don't like it straight, don't drink cocktails. That's all really
Don't like that mindset. Basing a future overarching decision off a tiny sample size is generally not a good idea. I'm okay with +10 again but just want to voice that concern
dont look now but cases have ticked up for the past 2 days... fingers crossed its reporting delays
Don't need a ride
Don't put interests on a resume 
Don't really know how it works but I'd imagine it's more like "a new science school is our top priority and we need funding to do it, if you help us we'll name it after you"
Dont really remember tbh. Something about an open beer in their room being a huge deal
Don't remember
Don't spoil it then. See if Joe or Marcus can get it. Goody couldn't and he's a trivia wizard and huge CFB follower. 
Don't tease, hanging out with cabbages is the national pastime of Ukraine
Don't they have pre fight physicals exactly to prevent things like this?
Don't think anybody is confused. Im am against any outside projection influencing the league
Don't think it's Asia. Eastern Europe maybe
Don't think so
Don't think so but it dilates your pupils like crazy 
Don't think so. Just (about to be ex) husband to Hillary's #2
Don't think so?
Don't use any of the above as exemplar papers, despite that many were written by tenured professors
Don't wanna spoil yet
Don't worry he also posted that in 2014
Don't worry he just sealed the loss with a game ending pick. All is well
Dont worry Schilling isn’t in because of “character”
Don't worry, "you didn't build that" is my credo
Don't you hate it when you're walking along the border and out of nowhere you get crushed by a giant sack of flying drugs?
Don't, but I feel like I should when I go out. Because if it improves my sex probability by 1%, I should do it

Double headers are 7 innings. They were last season too
Double homicide for @ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) 
Double our bet then
Double par triple double 😬 
Doubles are fucking frustrating since they’re soooo easy to get. Say it’s a par 4, 2nd shot in the bunker, 3rd out and over the green, miss the up and down. Boom, double just like that
Doubt it. Don't see Pablo getting past the second round. 
Doubt it. My sprinting consists of chasing fly balls and that’s literally it
Doubtless top 3 Davantes in the league
Doug Martin gets a "massive" deal at $35MM over 7. Meanwhile Zack Greinke is getting that much a YEAR for 6 years...

Down $10 on the season thus far. Can get back to even with ravens covering 4

Drachman dropping the truthbomb at the end there
Drachman got that tinder radius to 10000 miles
Drachman is a master of whatabout-ing, this time the defense budget
Drachman is a socialist
Drachman is uncle joe from Willy wonka 
Drachman should be Nate 
Drachman that’s basically what started the whole conversation (even tho the low level employees make 500k lol). The owners would be taking a pay cut on behalf of the players and the country. 
Draft and Brexit!! So much drama!!
Draft as such
Draft fields (unless told otherwise by the guru)
Draft in 50 minutes. Shall we hop on a zoom call too?
Draft only. No adds no drops. Auto picks best scores each week
Draft was fun during preseason but it’s not as good now. Lots of luck based on draft order 
Draft would be lit
"Draft: $157
Season Long: $225
Best Ball: $127
Weekly: -$72

Solid season overall
"
Draftees could turn plaster their living rooms with sponsorships and make an extra few hundred grand 🤔 
Drafting saquon makes even less sense now tho

Dray is at least consistent. Dude is a massive shittalker and emotionally a bit of a loose cannon, but he's not a grave dancer or criminal or anything. Lebron is full of contradictions
Dray isnt taking the right approach. Could be saying he had a better time, played the right role to win 3 championships. Instead he’s trying to turn it into a one on one against an MVP while he’s been trash without the splash bros
Dray 😍
Draymond wears his heart on his sleeve what can I say. Better than Dwight who would walk to the locker room before time expired. And the screens aren't illegal because Harden stops defending before the screen is even set, so a screen can't be moving when harden doesn't even run into the pick.

Drew Lock at 15 is far and away the dumbest thing on that list
Drew lock sitting at 29 QBR entering this week. Mitch was at 53 when he got pulled
Drew vs Mitch QBR
Dril with another banger
Drive down the field, get to the 5 yard line, interception on a flat route
drive of the game right here
Drive was looking good
Driving down the field, get inside the 5. Run a QB keeper option, botch the pitch, fumble and turnover
Driving range
Driving with headphones in?
Dropped a 1 on 1 TD. Then just dropped a wide open crossing route and would've had 30-40 yards minimum
Dropping out means suspending your campaign. Technically he's still running, just like Rubio. But yes, in effect he's given up
DRose acquitted
DRose is gonna get a mistrial

Dude was pretty good at football
Dude went from loved to loathed in 2 seasons and it's nobody's fault but his
Dude went from rags to riches. He and Davos are the only characters in the book to do that. And Dany I guess 
Dude when John Cena fought Seth Rollins and Rollins fucked up a jumping knee and broke Cenas nose and Cena just fucking gritted it out and finished the match and pinned Rollins I went wild. I've never been more into WWE than that moment
Dude you literally do the same as me
Dude...
Dudes become such a diva it’s exhausting tbh
Dudes been legit good on FOUR teams now and somehow is only 26
Dudes fast
Dudes name is Mark Stevens. He has a Forbes page, estimated worth is like $1.6 billion, currently owns like 10% of the Warriors. Got his money by Angel investing in eBay and yahoo. They have 3 houses on their property, their main house, then a guest house, and then a pool house / gym / activity zone. Also have a pool with a water slide from their treehouse, tennis court, basketball court, full garden, etc. it's cray cray
Duffy
Dugtrio RB. Is he always down or impossible to tackle 🤔 
Duk, they don't talk politics in there?
Duke and Stanford always chill at 5-10
Duke Blue DevLOLs
Duke lacrosse threw a house party. Black strippers attended, alleged they were gang raped by the team. Nationwide outrage with major racial effect. Turns out the story was all made up, evidence was hidden by the prosecuting attorney, and the whole ordeal was a complete hoax.
"Duke: “hmm we have a rep as an elitist white boy school, the kind people see when they think about trump supporters. How can we change that?”

Duke:"
Dumb. But I do think the audience should be removed.
Dumbest delay of game 
Dumbest line in any book/movie/story I've ever seen is Harry Potter 2, when Hagrid tells Harry about buying the dragon egg. Then Harry asks what he looks like and hagrid says "I couldn't see his face, he kept his hood up"
Dumbest play call. Fucking backup quarterbacks first drive of the season (and career?) and they throw a fade??

Dying to know the context
E by a mile
E means enlisted. The number is their rank level. E-3 (private/Airman 1st class), is fresh out of the job school and new to the unit. E-7 (Master Sgt) is a senior enlisted, often joked as having multiple divorces.
e.g. even if you're pre-med, pre-law, business, etc. you have to take X humanities classes, which employers couldnt give 2 shits about
E.g. that nonsensical "keeper value resets if player suffers a season ending injury" rule

Early 2000s whatever it was when they won the AL like 8 years in a row
Early exit polls are often wrong, but this is the first meaningful demographics poll I’ve seen so far
Early Kevin and Andy were great though they're semi main characters
Early reviews of Quarterback are not good
Easily Avatar, then easily Fast and Furious, then not so easily Jurassic park 
Easily could've gone for 5-10 more yards at end of half and get a FG, which would be huge now
Easily Maz 
Easily Pam. Though Karen was exotic. Wonder if her dad was a GI
Easily the latter. I think we overestimate sports fandom because we’re (mostly) fans and also tend to make friends who are also fans

Eg doctors who accrue a ton of debt over a long time, then rake it in. Lawyers similar but probably not as steep. Vs like liberal arts grad students who probably struggle a lot more
Eg if hillary did what she did, she’d be court martialed immediately
Eg Le’Veon Bell is 1st team flex and 2nd team RB. Xavier Rhodes is 1st team CB and 2nd team DB
Eg Thomas is at $70, $40 keeper + the $30 he owes to becker. Thielen is $1 instead of $31 
Eh about an hour? I’ve literally never been there in my life
Eh fine
Eh fuck it it's such an edge case anyway I don't care
Eh halfway. Like 5 seconds
Eh I didn't really mind too much until his teammates started hating him. Your own locker room doesn't respect you, I don't either. 
Eh I don't feel bad about this one. I didn't expect Pence to accept, but he's been on the shortlist for a while.
Eh I don't mind. I care only about talent and ability to not get arrested 
Eh I half disagree with that since your success scenario depends on other people losing. If the goal is truly to last as long as possible (and not just outlast others), then I agree John
Eh I take it back. Tiger over the Babe. Really tough to compare babe to the others.
Eh I was sorta close 
Eh I’m over Ronda
Eh idk about that one
Eh idk I just put them in the sports poser (aka the Kelltics) bucket and leave it at that 
Eh idk. There’s cameras everywhere, it’s a ton of pressure. I can easily see myself shooting a bad round due to all that
Eh iirc you didn't miss much. It wasn't terribly conclusive
Eh I'm gonna defend them on that one. Sports are sports. For the election, they were actually the most correct model of all the big ones, giving trump the highest chance
Eh kinda. Not more than a little
Eh no birdie but not miserable. Koepka’s bird might have sealed it tho
Eh not like any of us would be invited to your funeral
Eh not really? I don't really remember tbh. I still wore sweatpants to class
Eh not your best
Eh she didn’t look thaaaat pregnant
Eh sorta, but nothing far off the mainstream. Connor and you are the rap geniuses 
Eh sure I’ll take it for $10
Eh that’s not bad
Eh there’s not too much he could say really. We all know the answer but he can’t say it without throwing Zach under the bus
Eh they kinda do tho. Or at least don’t make hiding it such an effort and necessity.
Eh those would all pass
Eh true. I guess “about as good as any replacement level RB”
Eh West Virginia is a top 2 Virginia 
Eh whatever. Maybe Smith will come out of nowhere and become the QB he's been failing to be for 10 years and make us all eat our words. I'd much rather face Becker in the playoffs than Goody Joe or Darrow, so maybe this could be a boon for the other contenders
Eh with wrestling it is a little different because college wrestling is basically the pinnacle of the sport, so HS is like college if ya catch my drift
Eh within a couple thousand
Eh, not far off actually. Trump actually underperformed his polls in the primaries, is over performing now. 
Eh. Figured after last episode it was pretty damn clear. They all knelt to her...
Ehh I was close
Ehh that just rewires the accounting
Ehh This is basically someone going way too hardo on how proud of himself he is. Mazz’s posts are a whole different level of humble bragging narcissism IMO
Ehhhh idk. Loved slime time. Not into bukkake porn. 
Eileen Gu is a traitor. That’s why we need to send all Chinese Americans back to china or to the gulag 
Either let the government commit genocide or create a power vacuum which will inevitably be filled by the most ruthless party. Literally, first world problems. 
Either make the subgroups legit or remove them
Either one of them can’t be subpar
Either stopped a legendary catch or prevented his own team from a HR
Either that or brain damage
Either that or dominating game 7 4th quarters, I'm sure the Celtics would be okay with either
Either that or he’s gotta spend a few more months describing the tapestries in the casterly rock mead hall
Either that or jet fuel fumes inhalation
Either way blank slate this year should happen for sure
Either way breaking it up with a long sleep
Either way he should retire and go back to trying to kill Bart Simpson
Either way I'm for daily waivers, no FAs. John is too. Goody is against. That's all who have declared
Either way it’s a real bad look for the navy 
Either way it’s classic Kirk to sign his big deal and be news cucked within literal minutes
Either way it’s tough to fault the Capt for doing his best to look out for his crew, and a bad idea for the Navy to punish him for doing so
Either way the kicker was an issue, but definitely not the biggest issue
Either way you're halfway there
Either way, he. Is. Fucking. Back. 
Either way, Hillary is really good at losing elections in which she starts with a huge advantage 
Either way, I don't think attempted coups usually go peacefully...
Either way, the policy aspect of this debate is already 1000x more than so in the presidential debates
Either way, you gotta have a plan, and that better not be “I’ll take which one is available”. Just because scouting is hard doesn’t mean it’s a crapshoot
Either your fantasy team suffers or your wallet suffers. I'd rather the wallet, but the alternative would be a nice consolation should I lose

Especially since F1 is big(gest?) in Monaco
Especially since he's known for fighting outside and backing up
especially since the Pack has leaned heavy on Davante for the past 5 years and never even made an effort to give him a non-scrub WR2
Especially since they predicted a HRC win at 2-1 last time (by far the most conservative of all projections) and online morons never let them hear the end of it, so coming out with a heavy biden projection will just invite the trolls, even if it's accurate
Especially since they’ve tried so hard to brand themselves as social justice woke

Every good thing that happens to the Colts is a direct product of Andrew Luck
Every one of us is meh
Every other country absolutely loves it. Too bad players on the dodgers have the same attitude as Becker and sit out, and thank god for true patriots like Posey and Crawford who play for the love of the game
Every person I approached: “I only want Adams”, which is to be expected. You’d know how these negotiations work if you played fantasy. 
Every pitch, slider slider slider 
Every postseason Celtics game has been thrilling
Every single play
Every single possession? No, they’re gonna be up 70-0 and try some gimmick play that ends up with a pick. Also assuming you’re not counting end of half/quarter possessions
Every snap the Jets dont fire Adam Gase is another black mark on the organization
Every soccer game I’ve watched for the past 2 years has had a bicycle kick goal
Every song on Cruel Summer was a party hit
"Every speaker from Ohio ever: “O H”

3 dudes in the crowd: “I O”"
Every team is stacked haha. 8 team league
Every team that has to quarantine means the odds of a giants World Series go up 
Every time BAML acquires a firm, they don't fully integrate the systems, they just path it together with technological duct tape
Every time either hits a bad shot, “yeah that’s why we traded your bum ass away”
Every time I see a “Sports”Center post, I think wow this is the worst post they could possibly do. No way they could top this.
Every time I see data from China on anything, I am reminded of this chart
Every time I shower, so like 5 times a week?
Every time I think “wow no way we can possibly get gayer than THIS, but I’ve been wrong every single time”
Every time I think there couldn’t be a more ambitious crossover event
Every time the bears appear on the screen I am disgusted we lost to them
Every time, unless I’m too drunk 
Every trade has been trade rape so far
Every year you should take the SAT and your annual income that year is directly based on your score. 
Every. Fucking. Week. 
Everybody agrees vaccination is good for the individual who gets it. The question is if (currently) vaccination doesn’t effectively prevent you from catching/spreading Omicron, how is it consistent to force people to get vaccinated for their own good if we don’t do that with alcohol, obesity, and the like
Everybody combined thinks about Marcus’ participation less than you do
Everybody fun has lefty is bar. It’s the DJ Android Asian kid who’s the best dancer of all time
Everybody has been saying your sexual behavior around high schoolers (and younger) is highly inappropriate 
Everybody has gotten a free win over me and every week so it's no different
Everybody I know who works a white collar job says the same thing: "oh it's not bad, I don't love it, there are good days and bad days, I don't see myself doing this forever..." Most people I know who work in medicine say they love it, and they want to stay there forever. I want to have a job where I say that too. 
Everybody is allowed to have a  wild period in our lives. Some of us drink too much in our 20s, others join Al Qaeda. Potato potato. 
Everybody is awful except Bernie 
Everybody is making it a trump jerkoff party. Cruz comes up and says congrats to Donald for winning, then never mentioned his name after that. He spent the 15 minutes talking about conservative ideals counter to trumps, then closed it with a message to vote your conscience. 
Everybody is super friendly and has a great sense of humor. Definitely unlike the US where people mostly just stick to their own groups in bars and stuff. The Irish charm is definitely real. The cities are a cool mix of old world with lots of history and newly modernized. Lots of pretty cool sightseeing stuff between the historic old castles and the natural coastlines. 
Everybody is talking about JJ Watt being a great guy yet again, but I’m out here looking at the OP’s handle like 
Everybody knows Darrow will be terrible, but for some reason lots of people like him. Becker says the craziest shit, but it only makes everyone love him or hate him more. Joe has little support early on, but everybody knows in the back of their heads that he's the best pick. 
Everybody knows he’s never been a great athlete and has succeeded largely because of his decision making and processing. That probably hasn’t totally gone away but he’s thrown into double coverage for an INT twice
Everybody laughed at the Bernie and Baldwin picks for being way too early. And they agreed Warren was a great pick at #7
Everybody loves a good #WojBomb
Everybody on my roster is on the block
Everybody saw recent-taxpayer Dr. Becker going full Republican, but I don’t think anybody saw John following closely behind
Everybody should’ve taken Lamar. I remember some of the media saying bill took Michel in the 1st to get that extra year of rookie contract and it was so smart
Everybody started off extremely strong, then lost it at some point 
Everybody vote
Everybody wants to root for the overs and do a big celebration as it hits. Smart people bet the under and win.
Everybody who voted Jordy must now give all their $20 bills to Jeff, John, and me for the rest of their lives
Everybody who went to Maggie’s wedding is invited 
Everybody who works for the mainstream media can be Gaddafi'd and I wouldn't feel that bad 
"Everybody: JetBlue is great

John: FUCK JET BLUE"
Everything he produces is gold
Everything is 90% off, and you can't spend more than $3000 a year anyway

Exactly how I feel. I align more to him than Rubio based on his voting records and general positions. But I don't like him and I don't want him to be commander in chief. 
Exactly how I feel. Plus they rage when people make fun of BC, then they mercilessly dump on other teams. 
Exactly Jeff. Like Floyd Mayweather made $220 million in 30 minutes and still can't pay his taxes. Clearly a poor person state of mind
Exactly what I was hoping for. How did you decide on those #s?
Exactly what you’d expect. Except much sadder and lower energy tone than usual 
Exactly who I was thinking of
Exactly you basically pocket your salary, which makes it decent
Exactly, the owners might think that’s worse than just calling a forfeit
Exactly, unfortunately. If the NFL wants, it could easily move everything to Fox Sports 1 as soon as contractually able. ESPN brown noses to keep that from happening
Exactly. Booooo Goody for setting such a terrible precedent when it comes to rule changes
Exactly. Only the Sith deal in absolutes 
Exactly. Scene carried by carrell
Exactly. That’s a serious cultural appropriation offense
Exactly. The Stars bring in the money, they should get the payout. 
Exactly. There appears to be no obvious negatively affected party, which is why I want to know their reasons for shutting down poke vision. Your guess right there is the best potential reason I've heard thus far. 
exactly. There would be a perfect straight line downward sloping line on an ADP to fantasy points graph
Exactly. Who the fuck runs them?
Except Bortles isn't a good fantasy player either 
Except Celsius is apparently the hot new thing 
Except Chan and John 
Except chino 
Except for... Tom Brady
Except Goodwin you are the Mad King who decided to set the league on fire with your bullshit rules, and Emyr is Daenarys who suffered initial hardship and overcame great odds to rise to strength, but now thinks she deserves the world in a gift wrap because her dad had the power even though he abused it and she has great tits
Except he got strep once and spent like 3 days lounging around the living room / kitchen and rubbing his balls all over everything
Except I do have to say that Joe Bourque's CoC came through in the clutch last night. It's performance was magical
Except I hated the juicy pear flavor and I used to give them to emyr, who developed a dislike for them because “I don’t want your garbage!”
Except I know that season he put up a dud in week 16 so the majority of owners who had him didn’t win their leagues
Except i remember trying to watch one summer after freshman year at BC and it was terrible. I think I just grew out of it
Except I was 2 years from promotion and 1.75 years from suicide so the rates weren’t looking great
Except idk why James disabatino is commenting with Isaiah Crowell TD celebration cheers 
Except if theyre corrupt and/or a criminal. Then vote against them at any cost
Except Instead of 14 year olds arguing who’s more hood, it’s 80 year olds arguing who’s more suburban 
Except it was the other direction 🤔 
Except it’s the highly educated progressives at elite institutions defending terrorism 
Except Jeff. He probably called this one accurately. 
Except make it “be 10% less retarded”
Except one cost wayyyy more 
Except one thing, it would be LOLbatard. Can't be diluting the LOL pun with other inferior jokes
Except one time I lost the little cap with holes to the container. Like the onion powder shield thing

Except that I agree with y’all that she is buns 
Except that person who would be pushed into the train would've killed those 5 others if he had the chance 
Except the ball has claws
Except the case count is at an all time high in several places
Except usually instead of a cool pizza order application with user graphics and all, it's some backend software that looks ugly but the client needs it because the Feds require it. 
Except we can’t have becker in the sacristy (heathen) so that one doesn’t quite work unfortunately 
"Except when the guy shanks 6 drives in a row and is pissed off, and his gf tells him to take another picture of her
"
Except with Bloomberg, who is impossible to factor in, at this point 
Except you could probably replay it on 1.5x speed and still see Becker being out by a mile
Except you have to conserve ammo 95% of the time and the respawn system annoyed me
Except you might get a bunch of 2005 Bay Area rap lyrics that nobody says unironically anymore
Except your hair isn’t that nice
Except your losers at the Capitol joke. That was A+
Exception is a prix fixe. But usually it ruins the first bite of the entree and often overpowers the rest of the meal
Excited for Becker's takes on this
Exciting yes, think NFL is fairer

Fair amount of evidence... If there was a 0.1% chance of preventing the Paris attacks by torturing captured terrorists, I would do it every. Single. Time. And i hope our elected leaders would do the same. 
Fair and balanced NFL official statement 
Fair enough. So 3 “absolutely not without permission” and 1 “you should ask”
Fair if he was the one handing the keys to Rodgers.  If not, sucks to be a scapegoat
Fair point. Gotta keep your mind focused on scooping that ice cream
Fair point. I would say of course not, but that contradicts what I just said
Fair point. Then yes, I'd be against that because it's unfair and fuck Becker 
Fair point...

Fair question, but Rosen fell further than expected, then AZ traded up to snatch him

Fangraphs has the same, then Schilling, Smoltz, Pettite, Glavine
Fans have been calling to fire Daz for 3 seasons. I hope we have a plan
Fans should always root for their team to win. Becker I’m not surprised because he’s never been a fan of any team before so he gets a rookie pass. But Chan I’m disappointed in you 
Fantastic article on how much a prestigious college affects employment and earnings:
Fantasy and gambling have 100% made my football knowledge grow tenfold. I wouldn’t care nearly as much about run/pass blocking OL grades, pace of play, how/where receivers win, etc if not for those things
Fantasy baseball is the hardest to predict IMO. Teams are so big, 12 categories... even third through the season you're not totally sure where things really are
Fantasy football players - we are 1 month from the hypothetical season, so we should start talking draft. I have made a google sheet for y'all to input your draft date preferences. Keeper deadline will be 1 week before draft unless anyone voices objections
"Fantasy players, incoming changes. If anyone wants to make a case for a position or change their vote, do so now:
1) 1 additional flex slot, winning 4-3 over WR.
2) Keepers have year over year cost increases (10, 15, 20). 5-3 vote.
3) No max keepers, 5-3 vote.
4. Trading draft dollars is allowed, but needs to be discussed further as there were lots of reservations. 6-2 vote.
5. Kicker scoring will be changed. I didn’t take a vote but everybody agrees. Will be 2/3/4 for 30/40/50. -1 for missed PAT and <40. "
Fantasycast isnt updated for me. Anyone else?
Far far far from over, but I’d rather be Biden than trump at this point

One of them being big nev to give us the background of the situation
Fast forward to the Air Force where if a product doesn’t have any typos, it’s a resounding success first draft

Feel like the Sports comedy genre was another huge relic of the 1990s-2010s that has just completely disappeared

First the Indians take over our spelling bees, now they're taking over our Jeopardy college tournaments. No wonder Trump won
First the refs time out to give the cavs a free play to draw up. Then Jefferson Steps on his fucking foot and pushes him with his left hand, no call of course. And Mark Jackson is a fucking prick.
First there is the issue with strength of schedule, teams not playing each other, etc. And there are so many games (and entire teams for that matter) that are essentially noncompetitive. Then there's the issue with meaningless teams being in hugely meaningful games at the end of the season (like the Yankees in 2012). I like that teams have a season to prove that they belong with the best, then take that crop and play a bunch of super meaningful games that matter most. 
First thought is that CP3 is either way too high, or one of the worst playoff underperformers of all time 
First thought: FUCK. YOU. JOHN. KASICH. 
First time ever Goodell isnt hit with a deafening boo
First time getting sedecordle in 18
First time in my life where I’m genuinely not sure the loser will concede 
First took golf lessons at Mariners point, where future masters winner Jordan Kelleher also took his first swings 
"First, this is about all of Ukraine (not just the Donbass) and also not about NATO either. Although the Russian information machine has been extremely effective at making it seem like both of those things are true. 

Russia wants to upend the global security structure as its stood since the collapse of the USSR. This means something like a powerful Russian “Empire” surrounded by subservient vassal states (ie the former USSR countries). Ukraine strayed too far away from Russia, so it must be punished and replaced by a puppet government. If Putin is successful here, you have to wonder if he feels the same way about the Baltics."
Fitz on that block tho too. Got the last 45 yards
Five (5) long yards 
FIVE seasons?! Insanity to take this
Five thirty eight had a good series of articles on it, which included The Wheel. Also had a very interesting one where teams essentially own futures of other teams picks, so their pick is based on how bad their pick-owned team does.  
Five thirty eight model is pure ELO. Doesn't account for factors such as Tom Brady coming back 
Fivethirtyeight did that 2 weeks ago
FiveThirtyEight has a few good ones: Hot Takedown is their sports one
Fivethirtyeight is semi freaking out over it. As are some other twitter politics people. Not really that she’s a socialist, but that shes an Uber progressive that beat the moderate incumbent as the heavy underdog 
Fivethirtyeight on potential Lebron destinations

Florida reopening all bars, restaurants etc to open 100% and also banning penalties for refusing to wear a mask. More bad decisions by DeSanctis 
Floyd didn’t throw a punch for the first 2 rounds, then “dominated” with pressure for the next 6 but nobody landed or even threw any big punches and it was mostly Paul leaning on Floyd in tie ups

Flying back to the 🇺🇸 today for Andrew wedding 
Flying home and just watched Rudy. Shoutout to the 🦅 
Flying today. Delay in the Metro led to me arriving at my gate 10 minutes before the door shut. I was literally sweating with nervousness. @marcus how the fuck do you live like this?
Foggy Bottom in particular was the best but I need to check affordability

Foles does not look good
Foles is a walking a 3rd round draft pick, so hyped about what it COULD be, then extremely meh when it turns into a replacement level ILB

Food for thought on gender gaps in the workplace:
Food for Thought: how would people’s reactions differ if the Coronavirus hit in a pre-super-connected world, say 1995
Food was super overrated. wasn’t a fan of the style of nightlife where they go out at 2 am. It was kinda dirty and I just wasn’t really impressed by any of the culture. 
Foods high in fiber keep you full
Foolish. Any team can easily get a Carson Palmer for pennies who’s just as good
Football is adidas 
"Football is my strongest but it’s also everybody else’s strongest. Strong at baseball for the season where the giants were good. Bad at NBA.

Very strong at 2006-2014 UFC but goody might be better. 

Below avg at CFB and non existent at CBB and NHL"
Football is the only other one with a dominant RB like Henry last year, but that rarely happens in the NFL
Football question: do pass rushers ever delay and purposely hide behind a blocked pass rusher, then break out and attack?
Football rules question: OL can be one yard from LOS when ball is thrown, is that right? Also, there is no rule against who can receive a lateral correct?
Football team has hope, basketball team has hope, new applied science center!
FOOTBALLLLLLLL
Footballs def the least clear
Footcakes and crab balls
For "worst ever" and other hyperbolic comparisons, I defer to experts I respect who have paid attention a lot longer than I have. We can all agree it's embarrassingly bad, but it's kinda pointless to put a label like that on it 
For 2nd 4th and 6th
For a 1st 5th 6th and future 4th and 7th
For a 3rd and a late round swap? Good trade for Dallas 
FOR A BEEEEEER BETTTTTT
For a group our size, we need to start planning dinner and stuff like now
For a KRO
For a perennial top 3 team that’s unbelievable 
For about 4 minutes I did lmao
For all his troubles or whatever, important to remember zero off the court incidents. 
For Allen iverson, it was a good thing
For anybody interested this Sam Nunberg guy is having an epic meltdown on a series of cable news shows today. He’s a former Trump campaign aide and close to Roger Stone
For anybody watching the WBC the organist just played the Pokémon theme song so today is a great day
For anybody who’s played Starcraft @Ayatollah Thompson @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 
For BC
For being the most reliable choke artists in modern sports, to the point that it is hilarious and therefore makes people happy
For chvrches
For college you mean? I'd think it's not as high as you'd think, considering lots of students study over the summer 
For company training
For comparison, Aaron Judge is only 8 months younger than Trout and is a rookie
For comparison, Team Golden Ticket is at 25.10
For context:
For every situation ever, there is a trump tweet from the past saying the opposite
For example 
For example "kike" comes from Ellis Island immigrants. Jews didn't want to put an X next to their name because it's Christian, so they would put a circle. Jewish word for Circle is "Kikel" or something close, hence, "kike"
For example you might get the wrong idea that anything west of 95 isnt western mass. 
For example, I "endorse" Rubio. I hope that I can prove to you all that I am well informed and make logical decisions, and since I support Rubio, you should too. 
For example, let's say you have a table that lists the FFL teams and their managers, and a separate table listing manager skill. In Access, you will use a SQL query to join the two tables, getting the Team, Manager, and Manager Skill into a single table
For example, say you’re taking or posing for a picture, they’ll just go up and nudge you out of the way so they can get theirs without waiting for 3 seconds
For Fuckholes hangout weekend pick a date that becker can drive me
For further research, see: Paterno, Joe
For future reference I am against spoilers in here
For his incredible support today
For Jeff’s wedding
For josh Gordon (unconfirmed)
For making my night extremely uncomfortable 
For me it was when she started dating a 73 year old man
For me it’s gotta be Avatar (blue people) or the shape of water
For me that was the 7th hole. For Marcus 12-13, for Becker 14. 
For moments like this, my friend. For moments like this
For my fake ticket, I generated 6 random numbers didn't like the 5th, moved the 6th to the 5th, and picked 25 as the 6th because Barry Bonds
For only $800, you can find out!
For Pablo
For par yes. I can’t make birdies. 
For perspective, if they have a 90% probability of winning each game, their odds of going undefeated are 59%.
For perspective, those are the teams that have an equal chance of winning the ship as BC, according to odds makers
For pitchers I know cole and Strasburg signed giant deals this offseason but again, backloaded
For president, no way Cruz. Trump maybe.
For QB ELO predicted vs actual wins, the "unluckiest" QB in the league by FAR is the FLB, currently 7th worst of all QBs since 1960
For RBs only, it was even worse (they didn't give the exact number, unfortunately).
For real tho this is why everyone hates politicians. Both sides agree there needs to be a massive relief bill, and quickly. But both sides are trying to pork barrel in additional partisan trinkets to the point where it doesn’t get passed
For real though Ortiz is def one of the most iconic Sox players ever at this point. Disagree?
For real though the testimony is sickening
For real we should do our dangdest to get 2 more next year. 8 team league is redskins 
For real. What are Asians (white adjacent) doing at a BIPOC party? Disgusting
For reference
For rockstar
For SDSU. Like, are they hoping to get bates?
For someone who ditched his original team and hopped to the squad with all the keepers, pretty funny to see the Durant hate from Benedict Emyr
For Sunday should we make plans to go to a bar or someone host if they’re willing?
For sure 
For sure but Id take my chances on that over than the other base or sub packages
For sure Cam. Also include Josh Allen. And if you’re talking potential, gotta include kyler Murray. I’m out on Jones, Haskins, Rosen.
For sure. The fans bring so much more energy and it feels kinda dull without it tbh
For sure. Was talking about this with Joe over FH weekend. I literally can’t name a comedy movie that came out within the past 5 years
For the aforementioned reasons or others?
For the Anesto 
For the content of course
For the future of the country and the world, absofuckinglutely
For the good of the state
"For the immediate Jamie vote, what is the count? 

SAT or bust: Me, Becker
Exception: Marcus"
For the last time me and Jeremy did not have a “fight”
For the masters 
For the most part yeah, but I am feeling better. Haven't yakked since 10am, and just had a banana and applesauce (thx Jeff) and it's settling okay
For the non members, too good to not share
For the non-clickers
For the Pats or in general? Because this class has some electric dudes
For the permanent assignments, yeah it totally depends. If I’m doing NSA style stuff, I’ll be in DC basically permanently. If I’m doing Special Ops style stuff, I’ll be deploying all the time, then being super casual when I’m at home. 
"For the playlist secret Santa, currently in are myself, Jeff, Joe, darrow goodwin, becker. Anybody else? 
@Cod-Bod: The Trivia Master @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD @Negative Chancy Reagan "
For the pool we got: joe, Kevin, Jeff, me, goodwin, John, Katelynn, Vinny, darrow, jac, Marcus. Idk who "snk16" is. Missing anyone?
For the record Friday hang out, Saturday game, Sunday golf is great. If we can do a Saturday evening activity (including but not limited to HR derby) that’s icing on the cake
For the record I don’t hate the midge, I just was kinda weirded out by him and didn’t like when he was added here because he was super weird
For the record, 1) she was of legal age 2) she was not in high school 3) we were not “dating”
For the record, I might kill myself even if Meyers doesn’t sign with the Panthers. But if he does the odds increase. 
For the right price
For the whites
"For this season alone:
Baker
Mills
Fields
Wilson
Wentz"
For Thomas 
For Trump... that's the first crack in the "blue wall"
For underrated faves, Memento and girl with the dragon tattoo 
For US only: Babe Ruth, MJ, Lebron, Brady
For what it's worth, many pundits are saying it's gonna be a Hillary blowout, and I've yet to see one that says things look good for trump 
For what reason?
For whatever reason, most coaches clearly think limiting RBs to a certain extent is prudent
For whatever reasons they be, the Trump campaign that hires only the "best people" is clearly an absolute trainwreck. 
For what's marketed as basically a shitty teen comedy with lots of titties, it's pretty damn good
"For word in barname:
  if len(word)==3 and word[1,2]=='ub':

For you personally, perhaps not

Forgive me if I don't feel bad for you, odds on favorites
Forgive my retardedness 
Forgot the author but I read an article recently saying that the checks and balances system has been inherently weakened by the partisanship of the executive and legislative branches, in that Congress will (almost) always support whatever the president says if it's same-party, and oppose the same if it's opposite-party. The natural consequence of this is that the judiciary is the only branch that is truly putting a check on the president, which of course has its own implications. 
Forgot to mention that haniger is a Mitty grad (rival of mmmBellarmine), so he gets the local boy power up
Forgot to say, you can thank the US military for this sentence
Forgot who (Joe?) but last year somebody said Carr is better than Dak and theres no way in hell thats true
Forgot who it was but there was a kid who worked at Newton dining hall frosh year who was caught stealing Vitaminwaters, but he couldn't be fired because he was on work study and that would basically be an expulsion

Although people who have contracted the virus do have immunity, it is too soon to know how long it lasts. So for now, it makes sense for them to get the shot. The question is when. Some members of the C.D.C. advisory committee have suggested people who have had Covid in the past 90 days should be toward the back of the line"

Funny how things seem to work well when you have amazing talent
Funny I've heard more people say that  the protest is not disrespecting the flag and the anthem...
Funny story but Pomps also didn’t dare touch it, then we got it because there was no line and I said it was good, and he got it every time it was available for the rest of the semester

Fwiw he doesn’t give two shits about hipaa
Fwiw I outdrive him most of the time 🤔 
FWIW Iran is also in a huge political clusterfuck with Raisi dying, Khamenei being old as fuck, and there being no good choice for successor 
Fwiw most coalition countries including the US are against it, saying it would be an unnecessarily distraction 
fwiw Nate Cohn, another very smart election forecaster named Nate, said he'd take the over on P(Biden)
FWIW not related at all to the Israel Hamas Hezbollah conflict afaik. At least not directly. 
Fwiw that’s what primaries do, with some thresholds

FWIW, SBNation Chargers comments sections are all blaming Bosa. I guess his demands the whole time was either guaranteed bonus money or offset language. They gave him the bonus guarantee and he still rejected. Also, the Chargers statement says that his initial bonus payment is bigger than anyone ever, so even if he's not getting it all upfront, he's still getting a ton. The comments also are pissed at the Chargers org, but more from a historical suckiness perspective rather than about this particular incident
Fwiw, the UDHR articles 22-27 outline a certain standard of living as a human right, “including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services.” So my default answer is: yes it’s a right.

Fyre. Bunch of IG models promoted a luxury Coachella in the Bahamas. People pay thousands of dollars for tickets. Turns out nobody has any idea how to actually plan and run the damn thing and it's become a catastrophe
GA Michigan TCU appear to be locks. Then USC (if they win) has to be it right? All other teams have 2 losses.
GA remains undecided
GA senate is gonna go to a runoff, with the GOP candidate winning 49.997% of the vote. Another big yikes for “your vote doesn’t matter”
GA-6 is among the most educated counties in the state. Trump barely won it, but Romney won it by 23 points.

Game theory has literally never been more relevant
Game tying Hail Mary with time expiring
Game was hard to watch. Warriors can't hit a 3 to save their lives (especially Klay 0/7 sweet dude), obviously curry was out. And Hardens go ahead basket was a total push off on iguodala, he even fully extended his arm.

Generally but the blazers nets halftime show is what made me say it
Generally the grassroots internet (like reddit) wants to keep net neutrality, which is particularly interesting because that is helping niche websites at the expense of the popular ones, which is the opposite of what they tout politically.

Gents I need legal advice here. I'm moving out tomorrow. My landlords are charging me $1000 for breaking the lease, even though we agreed back in December that I will do so. They gave no indication that there would be any sort of fee for doing so. On our lease extension which we signed in December, we have a handwritten note saying we will break the lease. Is there any way for me to fight the $1000 fine?

Basically a strong party no longer matters to the voters, since they are more influenced by social media and their peers than before. Modern democrats couldn't give two shits about what the Democratic Party elites think, and modern alt-right Republicans are the same way. It may be a reversible trend, but I think it's pretty sticky right now.

Gonna piggyback on the Bernie hate train to say Bernie doesn't have any policies, just a bunch of fist shaking demagogical punchlines
Gonna play devils advocate and bring up the the freeway blocking, where people being rushed to the hospital all of a sudden couldn't get there. If you condemn that form of protest, does that mean you are automatically against the message behind the protest?
Gonna remain silent here and let the league sort it out 
Gonna take some time to adjust to sea level distances. I think it’s gonna be a good 10-15%
Gonna take the opportunity to counter argue... The ACA made it as easy as possible to get insured (and illegal not to be), and yet millions are still uninsured. Might be time to consider that not everybody is willing to buy it, and callously, that's their fucking fault. That's not even to mention that the co-ops are failing right and left, and more and more insurers are pulling out of the exchanges. The entire thing is demonstrating itself to be completely unsustainable. Also it costs, conservatively, about $1,000,000,000,000
Gonna wait for 2:22 and throw on some 2Pac while watching 2 Fast 2 Furious to celebrate 
Gonna wait for Kevin’s opinion 
Gonna whip out the Elmo costume at  UM games?

Good 538 article on human psychology and assimilation of conflicting information, tailored for the political election
Good article Chris 
Good article on college students views on universities' treatment of free speech:
Good article on Cruz' college debating fame and legacy. Also it's from April 2015 so the presidential candidacy spins are pleasantly absent.
good article on ranked choice voting
Good article re our convo last night: http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-05/what-the-2016-presidential-candidates-must-do-to-win
Good article that provides insight into the GOP civil war. It's pretty long but it's an entertaining read:
Good article, consistent with my experiences. BAML Prime Brokerage Tech was >80% onsite contractors.  They said they're acutally about equal or even slightly more expensive on a wage basis, but they use them because they dont have to pay benefits, and theyre also fireable on a minutes notice
Good article, thanks for sharing
Good because you're literally the only person I've heard say that
Good blurb on him tho. Marcus MariLOLta
Good call but also duh lmao
Good call unfortunately
Good cheese talk cheddarheads, thanks goody for promoting this conversation with a “Hey XYZ, let’s talk about cheese”

Good convo guys. Night night. Go Giants. 
Good convo tho as per usual with these things

Good cuz you gonna love when I'm Jalapeño asshole!!! 😱😱😱
Good enough. From VIP box
Good etymology Jeff 
Good fake blitzing there, but damn Giants need to catch the ball
Good flick. Definitely recommend 
Good for him
Good for you John ✊🏼🇺🇸👍🏼
Good fuck the Rams hahaha. thanks for competing for most incompetent front office in the NFC west
Good game so far. And only 2 drives in the whole quarter
Good game wow
Good guess but no
Good guess but nowhere near the money
Good guess Jeff you are exactly correct 
Good guy USA. Tankies in shambles
Good Guys up 1 on skins, 2 on stroke

Good job becks. Brandon and Kelly got 11/12, missed the Darryl passing out one
Good job doctor 
Good job guys. We did it with aaaalmost no hitches
Good job Jeff...
Good joke guys 
Good link Jeff. Just unfortunate this election is literally 0% about the issues 
Good links Joe, but that's worldwide and not specific to the US. I don't have numbers on hand, but if the revenues are comparable, I see their point. Still, verdict is going to be "sorry you negotiated and signed your own contract," with a side of feminist SJW outrage. 
Good luck bruh
Good luck Kevin
Good luck shelbie
Good luck whatever you choose
Good luck 🇺🇸 
Good luck. Don’t cry too much when the Warriors beat the Rockets in the Conference Finals
Good luck. Hope you don’t get Holloman AFB, New Mexico

Good one tho, love a good brain teaser on a Wednesday morning
Good one would never have gotten that
Good one!
Good pick
Good pillows I mean 
Good pod, glad I listened. Some thoughts: 1) it’s quite a juxtaposition against Dan Carlin, whose detail makes this seem like a spark notes version. 2) id have liked to learn more about each of the civilizations instead of just their names. 3) not sure I liked the parallels to 2020 America, seemed kinda forced tbh. 4) first non-mocking GOT reference I’ve heard in 2 years
Good point
Good point, and I wonder if they controlled for things like that. They also weren't very specific about which majors / jobs fit into each umbrella
Good probably
"Good question 
1) we’re running out of targets 
2) ICMYI (check Signal) there’s a major operation in Yemen right now that’s taking CENTCOM priority, and we in OIR are prioritizing force protection "
Good question actually goody. If Bogut and green played games 5-7 I wonder how effective TT would've been 
Good question tho Becks 
Good question, and I don't know. The theory you mentioned is plausible, but I think it's more because they know how entertaining and polarizing he is, and now they get to cover him for 5 more months. In short: ratings. 
Good question. I dunno. And I wonder if he'll ever release his tax returns
Good question. I know the QB can but I don’t think I’ve seen anyone else
Good question. My guess is “no but it probably helps” 
Good questions: What was a difficulty you overcame? Tell me a time you saved time/money. What do you see being the biggest challenge in this role? What is your greatest achievement in academics? Outside of academics?
Good read on the state of the Democratic Party, where its headed, and the pros and cons of its situation

Good take. But I'm actually leaning toward Blaine since Kap seems completely unwilling to learn anything, it's been 3 years since his flaws were majorly exposed and he has done nothing to correct them. And he's clearly a huge prima donna

Goodwin according to the screen in my elevator, 50% of business professionals drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day, 17% drink 3-4, 5% drink 5+
Goodwin admitted that's not the real reason he's vetoing the trade. It's because he wants to interpret competitive balance

Goodwin's bitmoji looks like Seth Green 
"Goody - Harrassing him like once a month
Becker - he got refunded. We told him we know what city he lives in, where he went to high school, where he goes to college. We documented you said X at this time, which you lied about at this time, etc. threatened to call the cops and his school if he didn't refund instantly. He wanted none of that"
Goody #tbt to when we snap chatted James our dicks and watched him open them from a far 
Goody : Jeter :: Marcus : Justin Herbert??
"Goody = Packer (we don’t need a Jim)
Kevin = ??? (This is driving me nuts)
Drachman = ??? (Personality is not David Wallace)
Darrow = Mose
Marcus = Kevin"
Goody 3/3
Goody 4/5
Goody already said it: I support free market economics. If you deserve to earn money, then you should be allowed to earn money. It's that simple. 
Goody amazing D2 reference
Goody and Drachman are correct in their interpretation. The question isn’t about vaccine effectiveness/benefits/etc (I think anti vaxxers are retarded), it’s about the liberalism of mandates. And It appears that y’all are full on the “mandate everyone or be banned from society” train. 
Goody and Joe you saw it on Sunday. Def look better with hair
Goody and Kevin could match becker with a KC win.
Goody and Marcus could argue about the right way to write your name 
Goody any other recommendations for a solo well dressed young man to occupy himself with on a Saturday?
Goody any shot McGregor doesn't get wrestlefucked by khabib?
Goody appreciate the legit input tho :)
Goody are any of those correct?
Goody bet is all yours bud

Goody hates America confirmed
Goody hates the troops 
Goody have you taken GRE / GMAT?
Goody how about lance Armstrong?
Goody how do you feel about subsidizing Denzel P Guerrier's healthcare that he can't afford?
Goody how have you not done a grilled cheese and boob job special copromotion?!
Goody how'd he get fucked?
Goody I agree with your ranking
Goody I guess the pull up bar is always taken but the chin-up bar is free, understandable
Goody I hope we don't find out :( but yeah I'd vote for Bloombito if that happened
Goody I laughed out loud at that last comment hahaha
Goody I lol'd hahahha
Goody I love how mad you are lol
Goody I may be reaching here, but do you think the spy gate punishment was unreasonably harsh?
Goody I need the races (surely white), ages, and states where they grew up of Cousin James, Brother Donny, Uncle John, and Cousin Justin
Goody I think Chan just gave you your new prof pic
Goody I too learned a lot. I learned which of my friends are, statistically, weirdos. You are one of those weirdos. 
Goody I used to think that, but now I'm open to expanding it. Let's say a low level captive knows troop locations or supply locations, or the location of an IED. If they're not spilling the beans on those things, I'm for rendition. 
Goody I was just gonna say that hahaha. You could just fight them all or you plot them against each other and they all get paranoid and start going crazy
Goody I'd love to see your commentary on this trade as a third party
Goody if my coverage is better than yours, you have to get the sex change
Goody if you don't put your hand on your heart during the national anthem then you can giiiiiiit out
Goody I'll fight you for it
Goody in any argument
Goody is Derek Fisher
Goody is LBJ. Obsessed with penises
Goody is right believe it or not
Goody is running 10 miles in 6 weeks, he should be able to handle it
Goody is that actually his name or possibly the most clever joke I've ever heard?
Goody is that BBRef?
Goody is the crackhead out front. Says by far the most words and draws the most attention. Does insane things. nobody understands what he’s saying or doing most of the time
Goody is the only true clinch
Goody is the seagull
Goody is Todd Packer
Goody it's been cool watching MMA evolve so much with the rules and styles over the whole lifetime of the sport
Goody just salty because he was kissing Jenn Howard
Goody knows
Goody looking for the people claiming Brady isn’t throwing deep
Goody loopholes
Goody makes a terrible last decision as commissioner, Not surprised.
Goody maybe you're cool with daily liquid sodomy but I'm a republican and we don't do that
Goody might wanna jump off the #TeamBecker train after a sorry attempt at humor like that
Goody my friend you are one of a kind
Goody Nostradamus. David West to GSW
Goody on fire right now!!

Goody rooted for the Joker in the Dark Knight
Goody sitting out and screwing everyone else hasn't stopped him before
Goody stop inventing fake news that is parroted by your sheeple minions
Goody tell me how you feel about obesity causing major health problems and you having to foot the bill?
Goody thank you for cursing Becker into a crushing loss by my team, reminiscent of the 2015 fantasy football semifinals 
Goody that kid Andrew (the white kid) who we watched UFC with is looking to move on June 1 (in NYC). Probably doesn't help but just in case. 
Goody that was amazing thank you
Goody that's hogwash. It's easy to see the connection between a student/alumnus and their alma mater football team, despite BC being the bottom of the power rankings at fostering such a connection. That said I'm still a NFL > CFB guy
Goody timing of that decision was perfect 
Goody used the I have to cancel because my grandfather died excuse like 8 times 
Goody voting absentee living in your own state? I respek the extra effort now to be lazy later. 
Goody was consistent. That's all I can ask for. 
Goody was rocking a sick 1999 nomar t shirt all weekend 
Goody was trying to shop Stewart to anybody who would bite and you bit
Goody what date did you pick up OBJ last year?
Goody what do you want the CFA for?
Goody when he is cornered in an argument 
GOODY WHEN THE MIXTAPE DROP
Goody where are you going next?
Goody while that's admirable it's almost pointless at this point because it's gonna be either Rubio or Trump
Goody who would you pick: McGregor or RDA at 155?
Goody with double credit lines out here
Goody wouldnt it be a win-win?  You root for your fiance's team, and if they win it only costs you $50, which minuscule compared to what you're saving by not inviting any of us to your wedding
Goody you can have Jeff and Jamie or whoever the other two were
Goody you could read GoT
Goody you have superb hype man abilities but yeah no
Goody you just totally contradicted yourself. You say president has little influence on economy, but that economics is your #1 issue and private sector experience holds lots of weight. Meanwhile the POTUS has huge huge influence on foreign policy, immigration, etc. and Trump has zero experience with that, and has made the most outlandish statements of any presidential candidate ever on those issues. 
Goody you mean Most Popular Sports Power Rankings
Goody you should apply for GM of the bulls
Goody you should make it so that trades accepted send a league wide broadcast 
Goody you should snap that haters quote to Anesto
Goody you sound like a trump voter (which is true) whining about the rigged election
Goody you want the other 2003 awardee?
Goody you will rank the playlists. That’s an order. 
Goody your BOIIIIIIIII is about to fight 
Goody your obsession with Joe Bourque and cocks is a little scary
Goody you're a wrestler. That's called a guillotine from a cross body vine ride 
Goody you're amazing
Goody you're Bronn
Goody you're so brace
Goody you're the Josh Smith of fantasy sports
Goody yours is pretty similar to mine
Goody 🐩
Goody, John, you guys are legendary
Goody, man what a great guy. When I think cool I think Anthony Goodwin. Smart, funny, handsom, huge cock, what a guy
Goody, personally, I don’t trust people to make good decisions even in the face of good information. People are retarded. 
Goody, please take it
Goody, short reminder that you're the cause of this whole debacle you jamoke

Goodys last 3 posts are 1 horny meme and 2 in support of Donald trump 🤔 Is the alt right mask coming off? 
Goodys posting resembles his college sexual escapades: volume shooter
Goodys primary defense of Brady over Cam was that Brady is better to his eyeballs 
Goodys reading comprehension 🤔
Goodys take that spygate was nothing wrong is one of my favorite takes 
Google "Charles Barkley golf swing" and then you might be impressed that he was ever good at basketball

Got lucky I already picked the Cowboys 
Got lucky with the rimjob call. Then alleyoop goof. Then foul on Zion and one. Then miss the board.
Got me there
Got me thinking goodwin, with pass:run ratios being higher and higher, seems like a good idea for the DL to go full pass rush more and more, trying things like double stunts and green dogs more often. Leaves you more exposed to screens and wheel routes, but giving up runs up the middle is probably not terrible
Got my first DC lay last night 🇺🇸
Got my ticket home. Be back in DC on Thursday 🇺🇸 
Got swept in 2012

Gotta share with us the inevitable Liz (sal)T post whenever it happens
Gotta show respect where it’s due tho. Last week I criticized the Dems for repeating the mistakes of the GOP in 2016, and in the past 24 hours they (ie Amy and Pete) have done their best to avoid it
Gotta spend that golddicks money somehow 
Gotta swing for the fences when $120 of draft dollars goes down within the same week
Gotta wait for goody to call them trash before they’re locked in for greatness
Gotta wait for Mike perreira to explain it to us
Gotta wait to see who drafts him, but I'm I don't have huge expectations. Rooting for him hard though
Gotta wonder if Bernie would be doing better if he chose unity over ideological purity as his campaign message
Gotta work on the knife hand, but I’m officially a Second Lieutenant
Government pays all the insurance companies 
Governor was saying he won’t ban it, and allow the 4 students to play the sport of their non-biological sex. 
Grab her by the pussy
Gracias
Grand Maester Darrow
Grand Phillipine?
Granted at least 2 games he/we got screwed by our kicker. And the starting OLine was 100% brand new.
Granted East village did have their fair share of team specific bars that got real fans. But they were inevitably also mobbed with fake fans who are solely there for the crowd
Granted I’m 5’10 155 so it’s not like they’ll have a shot anyway
granted it’s extremely difficult to run a gigantic government body effectively or efficiently. but they still suck at it.
Granted Jameis allegedly turned down better offers 
Granted that one’s a bit more niche 
Granted that’s not a public insurance option but the concept is in practice 
Granted they all tied with 1 vote lol
Granted, I'm admittedly a very cynical person so all my observations and opinions should be understood as such

Great finish
Great finish for the good guys
Great flick great flick
Great foresight by Jets GM 
Great game between the NFC West non-leaders
Great game but geez both teams had one big play to win it and came up with dust. Stanford gets a shot clock violation, then Arizona can’t inbound the ball and bricks a Hail Mary three with 2 defenders in her face. 
Great game Eagles 
Great game eags 
Great game. Idk about that call 
Great guess on 4
Great guess, but no
Great in depth analysis of Captain Kirk for those interested

Great start for OUR zags 
Great time to show my Christmas gift to my brother 
Great use of philistines
Great vision from Godwin there
Great way to save money on chipotle

Greatest 28-3 comeback of all time 
Greatest moment in NBA history?
Greece : countries :: Ouzo : alcohol
Greek/Turkish 
Green means def would make that pick again, orange means maybe
Green monkeys. Just call them and ask to be put on that team. I made sure they have space  
Greenland
Greenland is covered in ice. And Iceland is very nice. 
Greenland or mahomes for 4 years?
Greenlaw face mask was brutal
Greg “Agholor” Ward 
Greg Jackson
Gregg Popovich 🐐
Greinke 
Gretzky I have no idea. Tiger lol. Maybe Jarryd Hayne?
Griffey over Bonds 😆 
Griffey, Manny, and Miguel Cabrera take my votes as most beautiful swings 
Griffin brothers have a hand in the basket
Grimace threw out the first pitch. The Mets have been on absolute fire since. The players and fans are realllllly leaning into it
Grizzlies had a TMNT night and rocked these bad boys:
Gronk is jealous of us
Gronk should’ve had that
Gronks posse is very anti-photo. I know from experience
Ground launched from within sovereign territory, non precise. There is a major major difference.
Group 1 for marcuses, most fire for sure
Group 1, we the most entertaining, which is what you want during quarantine. 
Group 2 is the emotional  support group
Group 3 is marcus and Jamie claiming they’re can do Herculean athletic feats, and they’ll prove it as soon as quarantine is over. Then darrow beats them both. And Jeff says he’s not betting on anyone
Groupme crashed FOUR times as I was typing so I was literally shaking with rage
GroupMe fucking sucks
GroupMe funniness hasn’t recovered since the JokeMaster Midge got booted
Groupme gets drained of power when we post gifs or open links
GroupMe glitching again. It appears 9 pm is secret Santa time?
GroupMe is so much more fun with him
Groupme is totally bugging for me
Groupme isn’t loading messages from 5:34 to 11:24 so I apologize for skimming everything in between then
Groupme on the computer ;)
Groupme poll: what's yalls go to beer that is relatively common in bars/grocery stores. You are allowed one for summer and one for winter. 
GroupMe sucks
Groupme today gave me major depressive disorder
GroupMe won’t load from this morning to 3pm and I’m sad because it looks like I missed a doozy 
Groupme, you need to do a better job of paying attention to current events
GRRM is another $20
GSP McGregor? Lmao at this point I don't see it being totally implausible...
GSP needs to come out of retirement and save the card
GT had 40 rushes for 978 yards and 32 TDs 
Gtfo
GTFO bone saw 
Gtfo goodwin I only want to hear astros slander
Gtfo joker lover 
Gtfo nobody comes within the same universe as the browns 
Guarantee if that was mahomes they would’ve blown it dead
Guarantee that even if you get a raise (good luck), whatever it is will not be enough for Liz T
Guaranteed Andrew “The Golden Foot” Becker makes that, or at least puts it on goal
Guau. Grande yikes.
Guess Becker woke up and decided to be a little piece of shit this morning
Guess Cain Velasquez and Nate Diaz better lose your number then
Guess Comcast is trying to finagle their way up there with the other big 2, considering their infrastructure is already so built out 
Guess Crawford moves to third?
Guess excel uses a 6-bit byte for some reason
Guess he doesn’t wanna be a fucking fighter
Guess I assumed. I don't follow the MSM. 
Guess I forgot about all great pre-Buster catchers
Guess I gotta spend the next half hour taking mirror selfies
Guess I realized I just don’t really like Wendy’s, and it’s safe to say you do like Wendy’s?
Guess I’ll go fuck myself then
Guess I’m the weird one
Guess I'm the only skeptic then. I might take a look at the books tonight and place a wager
Guess it depends on the state 
Guess its gonna be an international gulag
Guess Kap bent the knee
Guess Marcus is your secret Santa 
Guess none of us like feta that much 
Guess not. Anyway it was an annual event where we'd play Newton comm except you had to finish a 30 rack and 3 joints between the twosome during the 18 holes. Senior year during the round I may have pulled off something like that video^
Guess that diehard Tots fandom was pretty short lived
Guess that’s a no 😔 
Guess that’s how we’re starting 2021 huh Jeff 
Guess that’s part of why I prefer Foreign policy. Domestic politics is dominated by echo chambers
Guess that's comparable but I feel like the magnitude isn't even close 
Guess the "I'll probably take it" was a lie
Guess the big fans are still on the old forums like Eagle Outsider or Canes Time
Guess the edibles worked
Guess the FH didn’t major in reading
Guess the libs have turned another one
Guess the runner ups felt intimidated by the champ. It’s lonely at the top
Guess this was in the latter 2/3 of the White Coat Investor
Guess we have to add this to the Fuckholes combine 
Guess we'll find out. I like it though adding to armistead and Buckner on the line
Guess we're defining better conference differently then. I see 5 of the top 7 teams in the West. 
Guess we're halting the acceptance of Syrian refugees, but what policy do we adopt in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen?
Guess what. A lot of flat routes and screens, and then a few long passes that were dropped
Guess you didn't major in reading, doctor
Gulag

Gurley is definitely a steal. What's more amazing is that goody didn't even cheat to get him!
Gurley must be hurt pretty bad

Ha.
Had a minor heart attack that I lost track of the date and missed the super bowl
Had an awesome day at an elephant sanctuary yesterday tho
Had chat rooms and everything. Obviously super rudimentary but I think it was also pioneering 
Had conflicts the last several dates 
Had no chance to see what either would look like in isolation
Had to be a soccer player. Can’t survive in another sport being that sensitive.
Had to be, otherwise y’all might have an aneurysm 
Had to catch up sorry guys
Had to choose between 30 days in London or one night in dreamville :(
Had to go re read. Classic to this day
Had to make up for the Ingram loss
Had to preserve that almost 500 winning percentage 
Had to read the fine print. Turns out you either get the stimmy OR get to ask a question to the Fauch, not both
Had to scroll really far up in my notes app, but you are correct 
Had to share your post Darrow it was too good 😂😂
Had to. It's tradition. 
Hafley you wizard 
Hah I wish. Most legitimate forecasters are still bearish on him, though they also predicted him to be gone by now, and they acknowledge this nomination cycle may not fit the mold of previous ones 
Hah Joe wants to see johns snatch
Hah yep that’s it
Hah. Fag. 
Hah. Losers. 
Hah. You fake fans clearly don’t remember Tom Brady.

Haha I put a towel over the screen every time. Cannot stand to look at the distance
Haha low hanging fruit but no. @Joe Bourque You were there

Haha Rose is a clown too tho, even if it is a good point. KD said it last year: these basketball talk personalities really don't know shit about anything 
Haha wow that article... Maybe if she took the tone of "BC I implore you to reconsider" instead of "I am being personally screwed by BC", I would be more understanding. That was a childish response.
HAHAAHAHAHA
Hahaha alright well my guy is everything you described

Hahaha that's a very realistic outlook on an absurd scenario
Hahaha the clasping one I remember I saw a kid try it at a tourney and the ref called him for unsportsmanlike conduct lmao. Never tried it because of that
Hahaha the most evil questlines were the best. Dark brotherhood was awesome

"Halfway through (man this is long), summarizing the podcasts answers:
1) The PGA is banking on paying the loyalists a boatload of money and winning them over that way
2) Not addressed
3) There will be a reapplication and PGA board to review those applications. Unknown if they will take fines/membership “fees” and/or decline anybody."
Hall of Famer curt schilling said he credits a lot of his success to his splitter looking like a fastball until the last second

Hard disagree
Hard to think he wouldn’t do better, considering his approval ratings on it were really bad
Harden bricking open 3s and insta-passing to KD every other time 
Harden is also the definition of an iso player and a poor defender
Harden is basically Melo 5-8 years ago
"Harden is prob in there. Maybe Luka and Kyrie. 

But guys like Tatum, Shai, Maxey… zero chance. "
Hardest candies to power rank are pay days, followed by mounds and almond joys

Has addazio ever not been excited about anything?
Has any of these fights ever been worth the buy
Has any they ever been hot
Has anybody ever finished a quordle in less than 7?
Has anybody ever seen the dodgers and the nazis in the same room at the same time 🤔 
Has anybody read 17776 on SB Nation?
Has anyone ever seen them in the same room at the same time?
Has anything of note come of the name image likeness ruling a while ago?
Has he done that during the playoffs? I remember the famous post super bowl loss one
Has Jadeveon Clowney actually been good this year?
Has KD ever been the roll man in OKC? Honestly cannot recall
Has Kevin passed Marcus on the FH Golf Power Rankings?!?!
Has Mahomes legit lost the deep ball?
Has Pokemon ever made a failed game?
Has there been any leaks of what Lamar is asking for and what happens when teams attempt to negotiate? All I’ve heard is he wants a “Watson deal” and that the ravens and him were never close.
Has there ever been a past-his-prime to the point of being non-competitive but still is the hottest story in the sport, other than tiger?
Has there ever been a sexier man
Has this happened before?
Has this tournament in fact felt soul-less?
Has to be Ohtani, Mookie, Acuna, Freeman, Trout. After that I can see an argument for a lot of guys, including Harper  and Judge
Hasakah
Haskins starts the majority of games for Washington

Hate being cockteased tho
Hate Cortez. He was a total dick in the Road to El Dorado
Hate CP3 on the dubs
Hate it. Free trade and free markets are always better
Hate that call
Hate that call on 3rd and 9. Hit them with a draw or screen pass, go for it on 4th
Hate the decision independent of fantasy implications. Adds a massive wrench to their schedule. Both teams already said theyd rather do neutral site than reschedule. And those teams would be the ones hurt by ticket sales, which they okayed on waiving. Once again NFL shows it will pinch pennies at the cost of the health of the players. 
Hate to
Hate to admit it but I’m in worse shape now than I’ve been in a while
Hate to admit it but it seems like the Pac12 is slowly dying and the momentum is not reversing. The ACC might not be far behind
Hate to admit it but the eagles might be the best organizationally run team in the league
Hate to see a well to do respectable bot turn into a clanker
Hate to see it happen
Hate when that happens
Haters in shambles
Haters or cruise patrons are actually just haters of the middle class
Hats are 🤮 tho

Have SAT prep class that night
Have the PS4 because other people had it. Had an XBox 360. Never felt strongly about one or the other. 
Have they surrendered the lead in the World Series or ALCS even once?!
Have to be a win total under 8.5
Have to cancel. Too broke
Have to think he gets the tag
Have we a wager?
Have we considered that maybe Brady just loves playing football
Have we covered the Midge Saga
Have we decided on the policy for trading/buying keepers?
Have we ever attempted to square how Marcus prefers CFB because they’re playing for the right reasons with his support of the LIV bag chasing?

HAYYYYYYYY
HDJAGSLHFJELDHD
He actually dines on salted meats and hard cheese 
He actually led the charge into Pyke blackout drunk and totally kicked ass
He actually wants to play monopoly 
He actually went to college a year early
He addresses that in his speech actually. Said he’s against it, but also that PFT is basically his own brand. He also said he shot down a Biden interview
He adds almost nothing to the cavs, and what good he adds on offense is detracted by his atrocious defense
He almost certainly got got
He also gives himself chip ins
He also goes out of his way to be a dick to the media. Not like BB quiet but like long winded “you’re an idiot I’m smarter than you” rants
He also had to scroll!
He also has a no trade clause
He also left me roses by the stairs
He also loves Kobae Bryant
He also paid $150K in taxes to several foreign countries 
He also plays on like a 65 course rating based on his videos 
He also said he started jerking off with his non-throwing arm for fatigue reasons hahahaha
He also talks a lot about how a lot of the modern technology was being used in an experimental phase and the generals weren’t planning for what to do if it actually worked. Like the first chlorine gas attack worked better than anybody hoped, but the Germans didn’t exploit the massive hole in the line because they didn’t expect it to work so well that they didn’t plan an infantry charge after the attack
He also used to beat the shit out of bums for fun as a kid, and was a major racist
He also warmed up with WIND SPRINTS
He also was prevented from going to graduation for fears that he would attack commencement speaker John Kerry. He also had a sign stolen from his Mod and spent the next several days breaking into peoples mods to find the perp. (Which ngl didn’t age well considering the circumstances)
He always did it
He appears to have a very wealthy family. He changes jobs a lot from what I can tell
He asked about kilts and then took off 🏃 
He beat Mighty Mouse, Dillashaw, Moraes, and now Cruz. Only guy missing from the resume is Garbrandt
He believed people would be as selfish as they could be, besides the philosopher class
He blows unfortunately :(
He brings that up a lot. Like “what would my generation do in this situation. I don’t think I have the courage to do a fraction of what these guys did everyday”
He came around to liking me once he realized I didn't give two shits about kissing ass or "being nice" or any of that nonsense
He can make great strides, but not lock it up. I still think his chances of being the Republican nominee are <50%. If Rubio loses Florida (which seems more likely than not), I think he'll probably drop out. 
He can’t throw and catch the ball at the same time
He cannot shake his nature
He caught it but was a foot out
He claimed he could dunk?!
He coached Peyton Manning like 30 years ago
He could actually... save people from death?
He could right? There's no deadline...
He couldn't keep playing because his family couldn't afford it God goody shitting on the poor now
He def still has great boxing but tbh nobody knows outside of that. He has 1 win in the past 5 years against a 40 year old. 
He defended himself like 10 times, then liked a bunch of tweets that either defended him or attacked don 
He definitely expected a big applause lmao
He definitely sucked but I don’t think I’d put him on the hate list
He did get crushed. If that was Brees they would’ve called unnecessary roughness 
He did make a game losing decision that no other coach since 2006 made, according to chans stat
He did stop playing...
He did witness me stealing the Eagles for Israel sign and didn't rat so thanks for that haha
He did. He picked him up on 9/24
He didn’t ask for consent before plowing (into) those girls in the stands 
He didn’t have anything in pics from 2019
He didn’t have service because he was on a romantic date in the white mountains with a Dartmouth freshman
He didn’t major in thinking 
He didn’t make the BC quarantine house game
He didn’t message from 10:17-11:21 so I think he might have done it 💪🏼 
He didn’t play this week but yes
He didn’t register  in time to be on the early state ballots
He didn't answer your question goody, but I'm pretty sure Joe would pick BC Athletic Director
He died a few years ago and they were gonna name a building after him but then it came out that he had had relations with a recently graduated student who was in the theater program he ran. The building was not named after him. 
He does look very Dad bod rn...
He does say a lot of “this is the greatest X in human history” a lot but the way he tells it makes me believe him
He doesn’t care as long as he’s got his Tuckholes groupme 
He doesn’t have time, being the jokemaster in 4 other groupmes and all
He doesn’t work for planned parenthood so probably not 
He doesn't have any friends 
He doesn't have staffers under him, for what it's worth. But that's a big title. 
He doesn't have whiskers and a pointy nose and a wormy looking tail so no
He dramatically brought me from the tee into the pro shop to dramatically ask if it’s ok to let me play. The lady at the counter was like “I didn’t know that was a rule”. So he said he’d “do me a favor” and let me play instead of forcing me to buy a polo
He dropped savage?
He effectively ran play action flood concepts with Goff for 2 years then got figured out and has been mediocre since 
He eventually retracted 
He flying kneed Klay in the face and lacerated his ear and concussed him
He gave everybody a reason to question his motivation and he knows it
He goes straight for the muffdive
He got a lot of praise early with the Donald sterling fiasco. Seems pretty well liked, and I think he's pretty conservative with any changes
He got cut. By the bills. Worse than the worst player on the worst team. 
He got into a verbal altercation in Mac which resulted in him ripping off his shirt and screaming
He got mad at a reporter for asking what he did in February, called her fake news, brought up Biden, yadayada 
He got the big contract but hasn’t played for 20 years yet
He had 4 TDs last week
He had a touchdown in a saints uniform in 2023
He had like 50 yards in a game max before this game
He had that one game 2/2/2 lmao
He had the worst case of post grad weight gain I’d ever seen
He has a giant contract but I’d say it matches his production. And 5 concussions.
He has a picture of a rectum apparently
He has been below average this year
He has been hitting all the classics these past few weeks
He has been on a course/range before, but never more than like once a year
He has enough of not for all 2 billion of us
He has led us to our best team in a decade
He has no comparables 
He has no idea what Iron Dome does and why this would be a giant waste of money
He has probably been more of a difference maker than every non Lamar Jackson QB
He has single handedly turned a simple question about his acknowledgment of the 4 KIA in Niger into a full week of negative spotlight and keeps doubling down with easily disproven lies, just now accusing one of the widows of lying that he didn't know her husbands name when he called
He has the most disgusting body shape
He has the personality of a weatherman 
He has the Sam Bradford eye
He has to be actually drunk 
He has to be. He took the hypocritical oath
He has to settle. He’s not gonna get an “entry level CEO” job as my dad calls it
He hasn't said anything of significance about anything lol. The exceptions I can think of are: 1) the wall, 2) 40% tax on imports from China, 3) eliminate the state boundaries in the healthcare market, 4) ban Muslims
He hates us confirmed
He hurt his index finger when he fired that gun at his wall whilst beating his girlfriend
He is a cyborg 
He is a parody of himself
He is a smug motherfucker tho and I know a lot of people hate him for that
He is allegedly an r/wsb savant 
He is an equestrian tho
He is in the fucking zone
He is literally a 6 year old hahahaha
He is mind bogglingly stupid
He is slow as hell. He acts 70, couldn’t believe it when I googled and he’s 45
He is so fucking funny 
He is the son of Satan so it makes sense
He is truly the 🐐 
He joined BC rugby and made an immediate impact as one of best players. And all the BC Rugby kids were like "dude you came to like 2 practices"
He just defended his lightweight belt by 1st round TKO over Donald Cerrone. Like minutes ago
He just gave a heart, he's around here somewhere
He just looks so slow out there. Yeah he’s big, but he used to be big and fast and a big YAC threat, and now he just looks like a poor mans zach Ertz 
He just said it: they don't know how to not be the raiders
He just started Gen 2
He just turned up the TV to watch one he’s seen 50 Times 
He keeps hitting it closer and closer
He knocked up his ex gf 4 months before the Deangelo video, and basically was cool with letting DeAngelo take all the heat
He knows there is a 2 figure bet on it
He learned from Tito Ortiz. Washed up and old and generally vilified by the fanbase, but calls himself the peoples champ anyway
He literally just said he could beat all of us combined. Are we just gonna roll over and take it?
He lived on Newton freshman year and was always a super attention seeker and ridiculously outgoing, tried to meet and know literally everyone on Newton, but was never crazy 
He looks like a dog beside his bowl waiting for the “eat” command 
He looks like anesto
He looks like the hamburglar
He low key sucked second half
He made a blunder to bet all in on a hand nobody cares about 
He makes a good transition from how the ingroup/outgroup mentality creates a world where objective truth is ignored, since one’s facts are dismissed because you can’t question another’s reality
He makes Barkley look like a genius
He may have lost the millennial generation off the GOP
He miffed a wide open dunk with 45 seconds left in OT when the warriors were down by 5
He might be claimed as dependent?
He might not be able to answer, too busy keeping all the hoes in line
He might still throw 102
He must know that he's lying, and this is just a ploy to get people to come, and then he'll have an excuse on why Trey Songz couldn't make it last minute. Right?
He must want to choke Kyrie, KLove and JR 
He needs to go
He needs to step it up or be demoted to top 6
He open carries now hahaha
He owes us his BC Buttheads quarantine group power rankings
He owns a house
He picks his superhero name from the bar he hangs out in, which has a betting pool on which gun-for-hire will die next
He plays RT not LT
He posted a striptease video today
He prob thought he’d survived the worst of it, but Putin doesn’t forgive or forget
He probably just wanted to huff those paint cans 
He probably woke up and remembered he watched the game last night
He probably won’t cost much because panthers need to cut him, so they’re probably gonna take what they can get. Could be as cheap as like a 4th and 6th rounder
He quit his job without having another lined up, took him longer than expected, ended up not being able to make rent and had to move back home
He ratted both of us out
He realized he hates spending time with his kids 
He really is the worst
He really really liked Mo Bamba
He really really really liked breaking bad
He rolls to the left after his hip is down
He roots for the Dodgers
He RT’d something tankie
He said Drew Bledsoe played there last week
He said he "doesn't know if I have it anymore"
He said he can do the weekend we all could do. August something?
He said he used to rip the bong with the marching band and exhale smoke through their trombones
He said he wants Ryan to beat John. That's not admission to collusion.
He said he was gonna drop him tho. A preconceived loaner deal was never a thing
He said he was playing alone but the guy in front of him and a cart girl witnessed 
He said working with me is tough for him because I seem depressed all the time (seriously, hard on HIM). Then I asked if he had a problem with me personally. He said there's been issues with me pushing back on his asks, and I asked for examples. He gave me examples, and I explained I pushed back on those because the requests were wrong, and the client would know it. He then said I wasn't being clear on why I was pushing back (and that's when I really wanted to say are you fucking kidding me, you should know what's going on). But i said I'll be more clear next time. And that's when I realized I needed to salvage so I segued that into being worried about my performance.
He saw an opportunity for growth and he took it
He says he feels good. Next few days are big
He seems to be enjoying the newfound celebrity:
He should be impeached and convicted
He should be in the NFL and his protests are totally legit but I still don't have to like it, and just because I don't like it doesn't mean I am against everything he stands for
He should be put in jail for this
He should be suspended for the rest of the year
He should do the 6-12-18-24 challenge
He should learn how to pass and then be part of a 2QB, double triple-option offense 
He should say "well biologically I am 30, but I identify as a 17 year old"
He should’ve just sexually assaulted 40 women instead 
He smacks the shit out of the ball
He speaks for me too
He spent 90% of his time at the plex or dining halls. Every time I saw him soph year he would go "yeahhhhh just spent like 9 hours at the gym"
He started off 2/2 with 2 homers in a field you're not supposed to be able to hit homers in. Then he got intentionally walked. By then it was pretty much a mercy so he hit righty and "only" hit it like 300 
He still can. Just tell the recruiter you’ve never heard of migraines before
He straight up says "I could be in the NFL right now, but I'm waiting"
He strikes again
He sure was one weird dude... And actually I'm not sure if "dude" is the right word
He swung his massive dick around on the sideline so it created a giant wind gust and pushed the kick side
He talks about America as if it was in Africa 
He thinks it’s funny. And I also think it’s kinda funny lmao
He thinks they were unfair, and now he's throwing a hissy fit like a baby
He tweeted that ISIS is defeated and we’re pulling out of Syria. Nobody knows if it was just a tweet or actually an official command. 
he tweets incessantly about the election being fraudulent and attacks every republican who acknowledges biden won, including mitch yesterday. about Covid and the biggest crisis in a century? not a word
He was a good player on the Ners
He was a huge douche all series
He was a known douchebag in college. Had a decent NFL career before getting laughed out of the league with the butt fumble. Lucked into the commentator gig. And butt fumbled that away in the saddest and most hysterical way possible 
He was a major douche
He was actually a beast at Washington. Thought he was better than Dre Will tbh
He was actually washing his truck
He was always a locker room problem and a shitty competitor but I guess he's also a baaaad baaaaad guy
He was an Indian immigrant who said he’d hitched a lot in India 
He was arguably their best player last year 
He was at Marcus’
He was doing the classic Anesto medicine ball workout, and he threw one of the balls into the basketball court, on which Flutie was playing pickup basketball. Flutie fucking punts the thing away and screams at Anesto "GET OFF MY FUCKING COURT"
He was five time player of the week tho. FIVE times. 
He was great as his character. I found Carrells character more entertaining
He was great for 1.5 years, taking over for injured Smith in Harbaughs second year, then was good all the next year. He was a really athletic novelty, but once people figured out that he's basically a "check first option, tuck and bootleg" kinda player, he's been bad. We had Vernon Davis and Crabtree and a solid OL but that's about it. Also good to note that Alex Smith went from being terrible for years to great under Harbaugh
He was having a midlife crisis 
He was having such a good game too
He was just way ahead of his time 
He was laying pipe in one of the AMC cabins  
He was my Terrance Williams, but not nearly as Terrancey or as Williamsy as your Terrance Williams
He was never even charged. And yeah the girl accused him twice over like six months, and yeah it seems like she's full of shit.
He was on my softball team. Good player
He was on that stud 2001 mariners team 
He was on the last year of his contract and this new deal is a 1 year extension?
He was one of those guys promoting trump throughout the republican primary because he thought he’d be an easy win for hildog
He was referring to the eagles on this drive
He was seething with rage at his mere presence lmaoooo
He was sexting with Hillary!
He was so good that he influenced my terrible take that the bengals should have taken Sewell over Chase
He was so much fun to hate on Miami though
He was the leader when it dissolved yes. Whether or not he let it happen or tried to save it and was unable is a highly complicated topic that I am not near well versed enough in
He was the man. I used to be into SC2 in high school / early college and everybody loved him
He was toast by like hole 6
He was way more hate able on the heat
He was wrong, but I hate her more so I don’t feel he was as wrong as I originally did
He went to Bell, came out at BC
He will look for ways to make himself miserable so he can struggle against the misery 
He will looks to be a promising subject 
He wins
He wins AZ (called by Fox and AP), WI (won with 100% reported, recount pending), NV and MI (heavy favorite). Then he will be at 270. 
He won the batting title 3 times?!
He would be too logical and sound-reasoned to get nominated 
He would probably start talking about the electoral college
He would see through that bullshit though. He's smart, even if he's lazy
He. Does. Not. Miss. 
He’d be a 7x Balloon de Orr winner guaranteed
He’d rather hang out with marcus
He’d start for Air Force
He’d win the FH HR derby if he did
He’ll be ok. Were told to only shoot people with blue or purple hair 
He’ll finish TWOW. He won’t finish whatever #7 is called
He’ll invent some new bullshit in like 2 years
He’ll play a role, but going 0-3 on goal line carries while that being the main criticism coming into the game isn’t great. I’m mostly just playing contrarian here, he’s been everything the chiefs could’ve hoped for so far
He’ll put it through
He’s a crazy Russian Muslim 
He’s a loser and a butthole
He’s a married man and a westchester man now, so the 30 lasts him a whole weekend
He’s a Russian ultranationalist. He would never have gone through with plunging Russia into a Wagner vs MOD civil war and burning the country to the ground. Putin siding with him over the MOD (didn’t happen) was apparently his only way to hold onto his power. Suppose it’s possible he can regain it if Ukraine starts really crushing the MOD
He’s actually parody of himself 
He’s actually the only iconic bucks player I can think of who played mainly for them 
He’s allegedly not voting for trump tho. And I actually believe him
He’s also a dodgers fan
He’s also got some juicy unearthed tweets about A Rod and... Robert Pattinson?
He’s also had his best season ever for like the 5th consecutive year
He’s also my favorite 
He’s also shirking his responsibilities as FriendZone (ad) bet acceptor 
He’s always calling me a fudge packer and idk where he got that idea but I usually don’t correct him
He’s an inspiration to all of us whites when we dance 
He’s at +550 now so certainly a great bet but not “probable” to win
He’s basically becker in the PK challenge
He’s been a bottom 5 QB his whole career. I think he’ll be a middle of the pack guy this year, at least outside the basement
He’s been back and forth in Russia for a while
He’s been getting big pressure all game. Seems like Bucs are missing a big piece on the OL
He’s been getting hit 5 yards behind the LOS every play
He’s been wizardly so far
He’s caught on tape lying about the biggest issue of the century that’s cost 200,000 lives. He said “nobody could’ve known it would be this bad”, which is BS but at least believable. But these tapes show that he knew, and he admitted to downplaying it
He’s certainly no Tristan Wirfs
He’s certainly proven his wirfs 
He’s clearly just trying to trigger a certain Jeffrey 
He’s commending the Secret Service for being professional handling protestors
He’s done basically everything in his power to shake off the Mr irrelevant stink. Game knowledge and work ethic are there. Never not gonna be worried about his athleticism or deep ball accuracy. Still haunted by the ghosts of the kaepernick deal, Jimmy G deal, and lance trade. Surely we won’t go 0/4 right?
He’s down
He’s down 40k with 122k left to count
He’s going as QB5. I’ll bet he’s worse than that. QB5 is a push. 
He’s going easy on those guys. He hasn’t mentioned his deluxe corner unit apartment with a fountain view, his unlimited laser printing privileges, his time share in Pigeon Forge, his reserved seat at Beef O Brady’s, or his mint condition collection of No Fear T shirts. 
He’s gonna blow a gasket lmao. Just sheet annoyance for the past 10 minutes
He’s gonna leak a various reasons to different people and fire the one that gets on sports center
He’s gonna take 10 sacks. Needs to learn to get ridder the ball
He’s gonna win $40 from me tho :(
He’s got 8 more years on average
He’s got dat Bernie Sanders money 
He’s great but you NEED a QB
He’s had a 3 game stretch of <30% 3P% every year, it’s bananas
He’s had it all quarter lol
He’s having an all time season
He’s in funny movies. He’s not funny
He’s in medical so he’s non line officer. Which means if he and I were the two ranking officers in any op, I would be in charge  
He’s just a huge loser
He’s just such a team player that he’s okay taking less, like Kevin Durant
He’s like black Tom Cruise
He’s like phillys version of Lewis 
He’s like the James Bond of baseball
He’s looking like the falcons right now
He’s lucky urban Meyer exists or else he’d be the worst coach since Hue
He’s mad that we proved last week that 2020 Cam and 2019 Brady are the same
He’s more of a run stopper right?
He’s not “my” guru, he’s THE guru
He’s not a big dude, I wouldn’t be surprised if they give goal line carries to someone else. Incredible in every other aspect today tho
He’s not joking. I just cussed him out
He’s not practicing with the team. Idk the full extent of his non participation 
He’s not wrong that shorts are one of the only downward pressures on the market. The rest is lunacy
He’s on pace for that!!
He’s on the Mount Rushmore of election forecasting, along with Nate Cohn, Nathaniel Rakich, and Harry Enten
He’s prob gonna be the next ayatollah too now that @Former Ayatollah, current influencer has vacated
He’s probably a league of legends pro by this point
He’s real life Rob Lowe from Parks and Rec
He’s right tho about that being his audience
He’s right tho. Name a single other Japanese player who needed a translator on an AL West team who was a fan favorite superstar 
He’s Russian. He just does steroids for fun
He’s saying he’s anti union, except he’s pro union for Amazon workers because Amazon is lefties
He’s seen enough!
He’s seriously the biggest piece of shit
He’s so energetic because he’s powered by steam, not nuclear
He’s so under appreciated. I’d love to start a Bruce Arians fan club, call it “Arians Nation” or something
He’s super hot and so is everyone who kinda looks like him
He’s super innocent
He’s the ayatollah. He oversees the faqihs and can issue fatwas. It’s the perfect choice
He’s the best RB in the league by a lot but if a RB wins MVP I will shit myself
He’s the Canadian professor guy right?
He’s the older brother. He has older brother advantage
He’s trying outfits to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of the invasion
He’s tweeted 29 times this morning lmao
He’s without doubt “one of the top guys in the league”
He’s worse than trubisky
He’s your style of golfer!
Heading out boys*
Heading out boys*
Headline article on SB "SJW" Nation: why Tom Brady is a terrible person for refusing to talk about Trump
Healthcare is a tricky thing. With something more standard and simple like auto insurance, that actually makes a lot of sense
Healthy is the big question but easily top 10
healthy vibrations crew got back together
Hear hear! Somebody like Becker or Darrow definitely wouldn’t be worst!
Heard FriendZone (TM) has unbeatable lines
Heard good things about Charlotte
Heard it was a statue of the Dazzler
Heard that one before though, even a bit at BC. Getting paid to protest... That is a new one by me
Heard that too. I enjoy the conspiracy theory, though I can't say I believe it
Hearing rumors of Elizabeth Warren for Hilldog
Heart rescinded

Heat Mavs 1 may be the best NBA series I've ever seen
Heavenly
Hebrew Rodent
Heck even without the lack of contact, they probably feel best at like 260 but constantly eat 5000 calories to be 330
Heck I got fired for inappropriate comments and even I never sexually harassed or discriminated against anyone 
He'd rather be a 4 seed since they have an easier matchup
He'd win lol
Hedging is for pussies
Heh according to Wikipedia the term wasn't offensive until the 60-70s with Vietnam war protests 
Heh actually this made me just realize something hilarious. Bernie supporters wanna break up the TBTF banks because they're too financially risky, but then want free healthcare and college as if that's not financially irresponsible...
Heh and Lebron only sorta counts
Heh apparently we do need to do daily tick checks so not too far off
Heh both of them basically. Nets and Knicks lololol 
Heh but isn't benefiting good teams the whole point?
Heh fun fact those are all eighth notes^
Heh I (meaning my dad with me beside him) met that dude at a restaurant in Santa Cruz when I was like 10
Heh I have doubts about the randomness, and I also think that's a bad way to do it. But I digress. Kevin is right NOTH is the most glaring example. Other things include the planning and running of the concerts
Heh I just think it would be funny because you get the panhandlers every day in NYC subways, and this would be a fresh twist
Heh I lol'd 
Heh I pay him for the favor
Heh I thought the intro was overly verbose but the rest was fine
Heh I used to scam accounts too. But then I just gave them to my friends or something
Heh I was gonna say he's zubat
Heh I'd bet Stephen A's career is over now. Nobody ever watched first take to listen to Stephen A
Heh interesting meaningless odds on the presidency
Heh ironically Trump today announced that his immigration plan is changing, and the new one is literally Rubio's plan hahaha
Heh it’s a fun game theory exercise tho where you keep more players because you think other teams are keeping theirs
Heh I've actually noticed that cat owners frequently do the backwards way since their cats unroll the whole thing if they don't
Heh might as well be. Why the hell not?
Heh sponsors are suckers then
Heh TIL
Heh TIL all 3
Heh too bad (read: good thing) that your vote won't matter. And neither will any of ours. Besides maybe Mr. Non-Sequitur
Heh wonder what SBN would say about that
Heh yeah that’s retarded. You ever read the jar jar is the Sith Lord theory?
Heh you definitely have that already if you scroll enough
Heh you just used two oxymorons in two sentences 
Heh, feels good to win one every once in a while ✊🏼
Heh. "Longest"
"Heh. Tidal?

More like TidLOL!!"
Hehe just realized the sun farts a cloud in that gif
Hehe two hilarious pro-HRC pieces on my Twitter feed this lovely morning:
Hehe well played @Two-Time 
Hehehe the goodwin counter to this writes itself
Heheheh you should've written your name as some big NCAA basketball prospect and throw his eligibility into question 
Hehehehe Chuck you done just get rekt 
Hehehehe insult to injury after NY AG Schneiderman of “fanduel must be illegal” fame resigned in disgrace
Hehehehe that placement is great
Heisman trophy winning QB
He'll be suspended for next game
He'll benefit from AT&T more than most would. Too bad he went to some ass college though
Hell Ezekiel Elliot probably DV history but that's all behind him, or something
Hell I guess that's true for half of y'all 
Hell I'd be down to play both days, why not
Hell im not even against the protest. I just don't like it
Hell of a 30 second drive there
Hell of a drive
Hell of a drop off from touting Brady and Manning to defending Jake Plummer lmao
Hell of a game
Hell of a game 
Hell of a situation for the new trump administration to deal with. Although doing nothing might actually not be a bad idea
Hell of a spin from all 5 commenters that this is actually a good thing
Hell of an interior for sure. Wonder if they try make one an edge guy since they ran a 3-4 last year
Hell with ISIS now, they have an entire CITY and more that wave their flag. We have satellites and UAVs everywhere. We KNOW who the terrorists are. 
Hell yeah 
Hell yeah are you free?
Hell yeah goalie that was sick
Hell, one of my biggest gripes with Obama is his firing of SecDef Chuck Hagel because Hagel told him he couldn't pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan or terrorism would come back. Obama said yeah fuck you you're fired, replaced him with Ash Carter, and terrorism came back.
Hella

Hemingway called it heaven on earth or something like that
Hence last weeks discussion about the possibility of Connor filling Chan's spot
Hence the Q
Henderson and Ripken? For having 40 year careers?
Hennessy
Henry had like 90 more carries than the next RB
Henry has more balance practice tho
"Henry
Yeldon x2
Lacy
Richardson
Ingram x2
Glen Coffee (3rd round)"
Her campaign response to it was really bad. "No she's not sick, it's a GOP conspiracy theory. Actually she wasn't feeling well because of the heat. Oh shit there's a video, actually she has pneumonia."
Her fb prof pic is her hiking. Match made in heaven ;)
Her last name is really Machina?
Her name starts with "Pflu". 2/10. Would not bang. 
Herb pick. I will die.

Here's a simple example. Let's say you have a card that deals 6 damage, and the opponent has a card that is 7/6 (attack/HP). Your opponent has 8 life left. So: do you use the card to destroy the minion, or do you play other weaker cards and hope to get your opponent down 2 health next turn in order to finish him with the 6 damage

Herschel Walker?
Herschel WLOLker
He's a fuckin haji too
He's a piece of shit dude he sucker punched a 15 year old, then got his ass kicked, then the kid tried to shake his hand and Katt said fuck off, then said to the crowd "how as a community are you gonna let a broke ass kid do that to a celebrity"
He's a poo head
He's a Spanish pre madonna
He's also 95% of the offense but holy balls, dude channels his inner lance stephenson at all the wrong times
He's also pro-encryption. He realizes that encryption will proliferate no matter what, and the US trying to stop it will just make the US fall behind the curve
He's AVERAGE! There's your stat!
He's back 😍😍😍
He's basically perfected the alt-right asshole schtick
He's basically using taxpayer money to bribe Carrier
He's been shooting well, just so hard with the constant double 
He's been taking that bullshit "I pledged to support the republican nominee" stance for a while now
He's been top 5 for 3 years and getting better every year
He's calling goody
He's crying
He's donated to HRC, the Trump U case was glanced over, the illegal immigrant hiring a were glanced over, the bankrupting of 4 companies weren't even brought up, nobody ever challenged his anti-Muslim quotes as being against the first fucking amendment... They just let him spew shit until he secured the nomination. Now that that's done, time to bring out the cavalry
He's from your town Becks!!
He's getting a Jeter level send off and he's a (probably above) Jeter level player
He's going to grad school and moving home for a month or so
He's gonna be great all season and then call everything wrong in the playoffs
He's got it down to a science. And he's smart as hell
He's just using us as practice for attorneying. He doesn't actually care
He's Kanye. Anything he says gets a ton of publicity. He has all the money already. He publicly made himself look like a fool and a baby, then got straight owned by Amber Rose, then tweeted that Bill Cosby is innocent, and if his album blows it will be the cherry on top
He's kinda dumb 
He's like Matt Forte 3 years ago
He's like the 155 pound Velasquez
He's most effective at attacking her as a political insider
He's my #1
He's no Alex Smith... Or actually he's exactly Alex Smith
He's not the best player in the history of his franchise though
He's obviously gonna do both duh
He's on apples side actually for now. He says there's no such thing as a backdoor that has no vulnerabilities, and he's not willing to put every iPhone at risk
He's on the small council. He's one of the most powerful people in the realm. Do you even watch the show?
He's one of the best pitchers of all time
He's pretty good!
He's referring to the bitterly petty exit by John, I believe
HES SEEN ENOUGH
Hes successful as hell I’ll give him that. But he’s a loser because his whole life revolves around being cool to high school and college kids. 
He's the only one I've played with and his game 60 yards in is decent
He's tryna do you on the 50 yard line while the dirty birds kick the 3
Hesistant to make the trade if I'm team 1 also. Starting Funchess sucks, but Cobb has been meh, McCoy injury risk scares me
Hester must be livid

Hilarious
Hilarious and under appreciated joke
Hilarious awkward moment at work today. We had a meeting with a bunch of allies including some Japanese dudes. My teammate mentioned the results of the Doolittle exercise last year. (It has since been renamed because the Doolittle raid was a big attack on Japan in WWII.) The Japanese contingent immediately interrupted and said “i thought you don’t call it that anymore”
Hilarious economics at work:
Hilarious if true
Hilarious story my coworker told me. He's from India and came to Boston on a student visa in 2008 (at BC CSOM Grad actually). They went to a Yankees Sox game at Fenway, and he wore a Yankees hat that someone gave him back in India because it was the "logo of America". Literally didn't even realize it was a Yankees hat. Goes to Fenway and is mercilessly heckled by everyone in sight. He's like "holy shit Boston is the most racist place in the world". Eventually someone heckles him to burn his hat, and he finally clued in and laughed at himself. 
Hilarious that it could be either
Hilarious that Texas football might be the weak link there
Hilarious Toney
Hilarious words from Mr “whoever wins the game isn’t necessarily the better team”

Hilary's got the nom locked up though. Bernies two strongest states are Iowa and NH. Starting with SC and beyond, Hillary is dominating

Hillary sucks
Hillary took the NYC subway yesterday 
Hillary trying to be young jokes are my favorite
Hillary was a uniquely bad candidate and saying she is an accurate barometer for moderate democrats, while ignoring the resounding success of moderate democrats in the 2018 midterms, is absurd

His agent deserve a raise that’s for sure
His agent^
His average was so high though. Sosa. 
His barstool article today was legendary
His best pitch it a skrubal
His brother on Twitter was pure gold
His clothes are a generation old. I saw this Reddit post comparing his suit styles to the suits in the NBA draft in the early 90s, they're basically the same boxy baggy fit
His eyes are too close together
His face is also symmetrical if you were to photoshop it upside down
His IG editgness 2 hours ago
his long putting has been pretty good with Phil’s coaching
His mom is Peruvian or something 
His name is literally half an inch above your comment. How do you misspell that?
His official statement lasted about 12 hours 😂😂😂
His one job was to take down the chief of staff. He's like a political suicide bomber
His own teammates on the giants hated him tho. Has to be more than just shit talk for that
His Pornhub subscription expired
His secret rodeo name is Mason Saunders 
His stats weren’t special but I think his talent ceiling is the roof 
His sub stack is very good. Smart dude, wayyy more progressive than me, but I always feel like I learn from his writing.
His testicles
His thigh is bigger than my torso
His twitter feed is lined with “just left a hipster coffee shop, and overheard...” (insert something about antifa or conspiracy to assassinate trump or something)

Hm I’m either a skimmer or a forgetter
Hm I’m not gonna fade vegas. No offer
Hm maybe I’ll start donating $5 a year  then
Hm okay. Thanks for the input
Hm so basically you'd have to identify which ones are normal. So start with 4 and 4. If equal, all 8 are normal. If not, you know the third set is normal. So then you have at most 8 abnormal candidates left. You take them and do the 3 and 3.
Hm that doesn't make much sense to me... how do you do that to a near-monopoly sports league
Hm that's actually pretty good bullshit
Hm thought lots of medical nomenclature came from Latin
Hm thought there was a decent shot he’d sign with Buffalo after the whole Shady deal
Hm too bad I was hoping he'd be a Lincoln Lawyer
Hm true
Hm well apparently none were positives but close contacts? 
Hm well I'm not terribly familiar with the current headphone product market so I was never gonna get the joke
Hm yeah I guess upon review idk if it was intentionally dirty... he was approaching the first down and Alonso led with the shoulder
Hm. Beltre?
Hm. Thought the Penix mightier than the Bonix
Hmm AI, Wilt, Russ?
Hmm gotta be Europe right?
Hmm gotta be something about toggling the light when you've been there twice...
Hmm I do hate the environment 
Hmm I like the take. I think I’d bet on the rams at Pats -5 tho
Hmm I wonder if he's trying to change Marcus' name to Nongas
Hmm it doesn't sound that weird on scale but I feel like it would if I heard it in a song
Hmm it would have to be someone who steals a lot to take that risk, so I'm gonna guess Rickey Henderson
hmm that james holzhauer-looking guy is kinda hot
Hmm two contradictory statements, if only we had a lawyer in here

Honest question is there a demographic difference for that attitude?
Honestly 2014 was worse than 2013 
Honestly a lot of my class choices were really dumb, but I don’t think that made any meaningful difference 
Honestly at least fan base circlejerkers are in support of a team 
Honestly big year for the Koreans with K pop and now best picture 
Honestly can’t get enough of the Kyrie vs Boston drama
Honestly can’t think of anything that went wrong in the lead up to FH weekend
Honestly creeping closer to 3️⃣
Honestly don’t hate Dak +4000
Honestly Eagles Wentz and Ravens Flacco are kinda similar 
Honestly gotta respect the hustle n that guy 
Honestly great question. Maybe be the LT on a team with 4 800+ rushers 
Honestly hard reset would only be needed to add FH back. And nobody wants to do that
Honestly I feel like it might be a good tactic to throw punches. It might help her personality / image appeal, since that can't get much worse right now. Plus trump is so disliked nationally that I feel like people would respond well to that kind of attack on him. 
Honestly I think I could beat all the FH combined in golf
Honestly I think whoever wins between Rubio or Cruz will beat Hillary. Very little faith in her ability to hold up. 
Honestly I would be betting on a topic I know nothing about so I’m gonna pass. Glad I had some time to think about it
Honestly I’m almost jealous 
Honestly I’ve been such a fair and consistent commissioner it’s scary
Honestly I'd probably write in Rubio lol
Honestly if Denver can land Stafford they’re an instant contender
Honestly if this is a troll it’s the best one in groupme history 
honestly im glad that I outbid everybody by so much. it means that i know that none of you will ever place competitive bids for future free agents
Honestly klay is probably the ideal fit for Lebron 
Honestly Lion King deserves its own top 3
Honestly looks fine to me now
Honestly must suck for the girls who are not total bitches to him (or other similar weirdos) and are rewarded with  unbridled creepiness
Honestly next up might be me
Honestly no idea. Afraid it would spell the beginning of end of the republic as we know it
Honestly no they’ve always been beta lib cuck poors
Honestly not the answer I was hoping for from the future AD
honestly one of my favorite quotes of all time
Honestly packers gotta be up there over the last few weeks
Honestly probably the Patriots 
Honestly Staley seat warming too. His play calling is just horrendous, as much as the analytics bros (me) love his aggressiveness
Honestly taking over the British line of succession is one of the greatest feats in American history
Honestly that might be me
honestly the 2013 list is better, lets go with that one
Honestly the herb and Watson look pretty enticing at those odds 
Honestly the most valuable piece of that trade was the $3
Honestly the Texans greatly exceeded my expectations 
Honestly the whole thing was a huge win-win, hot action for me and hot content for the FH 
Honestly the worst part of the whole thing was the MREs
Honestly this was one of the worst sports weeks in my life 
Honestly though it’s such a great 180 from the days when MJ and AI were the biggest stars
"Honestly Tom Brady is the greatest football player of all time, as of today at least. In a decade, who knows though, because Cam Newton is a once in a lifetime talent and he's only getting better. And given both of those things, you really have to credit the Broncos for beating both of them back to back. And if I can appreciate that kind of defensive low scoring play, I should be able to appreciate the nuances of a complex game like soccer too.

Also, Andrew Becker, while high in the bitch power rankings, truly does make the groupme go round."
Honestly wonder if sideline reporters are gonna be extra on point for the rest of the season. Never before has the microscope been on them like this
Honestly yeah probably 
Honestly, I would be as nice as possible, no tinge of anything that could be construed as dickish. Never know if EMC and you will be referenced together again
Honestly, I'd probably lie in bed for a week, then spend all my money on lottery tickets as I slowly go insane, then move back to my parents house and comment angry things anonymously on the internet while I play video games for the rest of my life 
Honestly, maybe top 15 tbh...
Honestly, prob +2500
Honesty I feel like DL trickery is better utilized with mediocre players, who probably won’t get by their man anyway, but can force weirdness and open 1v1s for the better guys
Honesty I put it in the same-ish category as Cookie Crisp because it’s trash cookies and trash marshmallows, but it’s “Candy for breakfast!” and sugary as hell so that sold it to kids
Honesty I’m kind of honored
Honesty is the best policy 
Honesty shout out to the MLB for getting its shit together after the disaster out of the gate. Might’ve saved it’s season (dare I speak too soon)

Hub Pub, not Tub. That makes sense. 
Hue Jackson is a bum
Hue Jackson is a miserable coach
Hue Jackson is worth at least -4 wins on his own
Huehuehue love the double entendres 
Huge

Huge balls Andy Reid
Huge balls Campbell
Huge balls Chargers
Huge day for Ukraine. Russians have retreated from Izyum in the east, one of the key strongholds that Russia overran early in the war and used as a logistics hub for all their eastern front operations.
Huge defense there
Huge difference in Packers O when they’re slow huddle vs uptempo (lafleur vs Rodgers calling plays?). Trubisky looks terrible
Huge hazard by matsuyama we got a match boiz!
Huge loss for the FH. Send him on a wild goose chase and “lie” about supporting him in blue body paint. 
Huge missed opportunity for “nothing slips through Frank’s audits”
Huge missed opportunity to get 2 more revolutionaries 
Huge opportunity to go sicko mode 
Huge response there
Huge stop for Auburn, muffed punt, Bama recovery 
"Huge UFC card on tonight. Prelims going on now on ESPN. 

And I gotta say the no audience is frickin weirddddd"
Huge W stan 
Huge win for the libs and instead of celebrating they say “well they’re still horrible people”
Huge. HUGE!
Huh someone should make a bet on that
Hundo p
Hundreds of thousands of civilians will be dead whether we get involved or not. I’m not taking a side here, but let’s not pretend that’s not the case 
Hunter and rats easily
Hunter Henry ACL. So it begins :(
Hurt ankle, can play on it but I guess doesn't want to risk worse 
Hurts benched
Hurts contract feels right for the Eagles. Higher AAV for a shorter deal considering his playstyle 
Hurts is better than Tua
Hurts MVP +3000 was so close
Hurts MVP not totally dead 🙏🏼 
Hush you don't get my hopes up
Hydroxycloroquine, time to work your magic 
Hyperinflation is your friend
Hypocritical ass NBA. Definition of hashtag activism
Hypothesis: BB saw the RPO revolution and bet that he could push the edge with dual role blocker/pass catchers. He’s either wrong or too far ahead of the curve. 
I (white) have checkmate in 2 if he doesn’t defend, see if you can find it
I <3 statistical anomalies 
I ❤️ sox fans 
I absolutely respect the doubling down that a better round on a different day could’ve overcome the 13 shot loss
I accept
I accidentally helped Mazz get revenge!!
I acknowledge Jon Jones is probably the MMA GOAT but I fucking hate his guts and root for him to lose every fight 
I acknowledge your first point, but remember friggin Alabama went D when Roy Moore was the nominee. It wasn’t likely, but it was plausible. Now it’s not plausible. 
I actually cannot go sorry
I actually cannot think of a single person I’ve ever met in my life who I wouldn’t choose over Bill 
I actually disagree with you there. Yelling at a wall is pointless even when you’re right
I actually do know someone lol
I actually don’t care as much about that as I do about competitive college sports becoming limited to a cabal of top donor schools 
I actually don’t hate the Steelers plan: beef up the OL, see what you can get from Russ and Fields, to Pickens and muth, then get a QB when the rest of the team is better. They appear to have a strategy at least. 
I actually don’t see what’s wrong with this?
I actually don’t think I met Joe, Nick, or Chan until senior year
I actually don’t think I’ve ever had papa Gino’s. Doms is delicious tho
I actually don’t this this is wildly off
I actually don't like unions because they're barriers to free market economics, but I can see the use of them in the current bullshit system 
I actually don't think he trains that hard, he just thinks he does
I actually enjoyed it more as an older kid. You could do cooler stuff on outings and had very little supervision in my troop
I actually got the idea because I heard two girls say have that exact convo in an ATM room lmao
I actually hate the online BC fan culture. They’re poor winners and poor losers.
I actually hate this leaderboard 
I actually have no idea. I don’t know any historic low points in the world besides the Dead Sea and Death Valley which already got got
I actually have some extra cash lying around so if anybody has any hot stock tips, im all ears
I actually haven’t listened to the full taylor album yet. I listened to 3 songs and it was not the mood I was going for so I turned it off.
I actually haven't had as much time to play this year. Think I only did 3 weeks and I'm negative like 20 bucks, so I'm not personally too upset. Also I currently work in NJ and could still theoretically play from there
I actually laughed out loud at that hahahaha
I actually laughed while on the phone
I actually like /r/malefashionadvice even though I still dress like a 17 year old
I actually like green too
I actually mostly agree with mazz on that post lol 
I actually occasionally like skip because he actually makes bold predictions (even though he always has an excuse when he's wrong). Everybody else just repeats whatever narrative their network is pushing
I actually paused and considered using "supersede" for that very reason, but that is grammatically less correct
I actually prefer sending privately. That way we get to see them all as a surprise
I actually refuse. Too disgusted
I actually saw a Kite Runner show by the Santa Clara drama team when I was at bellarmine. The rapist dropped trou and then the curtains closed, to answer your question
I actually should be #1 in the Overall Managerial Skills category. Made 3 trades, came out ahead in all 3. Still made the playoffs despite a myriad of injuries to crucial players. Invented the rules governing keeper trading, as well as derivatives trading.
I actually think Donny T was involved somehow, as an investor or sponsor or something
I actually think Foles is worse than Mitch 
I actually think football IQ (while also super important) is completely different than decision making. Like knowing what route concepts and intended effects, reading defensive coverages (football IQ) is super important. But if you know all that and can’t quickly look down the progressions, know when and when not to go off script, it’s still bad. 
I actually think goodwin might be in the top 0.1 percentile of understanding the NBA CBA
I actually think I liked the show version better
I actually think the best meal I ever cooked was in Florence. I made chicken thighs simmered in rosemary olive oil infused (check out that word) with those little dried hot peppers, and pasta with pesto.
I actually think this is like the lowest stakes thing ever but it’s good drama
I actually think Yeezus is better than TLOP
I actually thought that for a sec but it didn’t fit in my head
I actually thought the deadpan delivery made it funnier
I actually wish it worked out too hahaha I would've fallen for it totally
I actually wonder: is public perception of Cam better or worse than Manziel? I'd bet Cams is more favorable. 
I actually work for a consulting group that charges Goldman Sachs an unnecessary premium for my services, so actually I'm damaging the bad guys, therefore making me a good guy
I actuallysaw that meme on Twitter as a “hilariously bad Middle East take”
I admire the confidence of telling Kevin that a picture he said wasn’t of him is actually him
I admire the optimism. There is also the possibility/likelihood that it creates more resentment and division 
I admire your inability to be wrong about any sports take despite any and all evidence to the contrary 
I admit I bought into the bills soft rebuild narrative in the offseason. Boy was that wrong 
I admit responsibility for one of the two things
I admit that I wasn't there to witness it first hand, but didn't you win the so called "Posa" multiple times?
I admittedly got got
I admittedly got got
I agree
I agree AR is ass. Maybe the colts agree. But he’s literally a young project QB sitting behind a bridge QB
i agree BMI is not a great metric of healthiness, but man imagine the pushback if the metric was the ability to run a mile in ~12 minutes
I agree Browns mid-late 2010s was a success from a capital perspective. But the coaching has not turned it to a team success just yet
I agree but compared to the other groups it’s probably the least inaccurate 
i agree but its possible, if surprising
I agree but point 1 is still true. The burglaries, car jackings, ATV gangs, etc. across DC are unacceptably high, but also the shootings are pretty localized
I agree but that’s not the funniest outcome 
I agree Chan 
I agree desantis deserves criticism, but I actually agree with Marcus that Cuomo was a disaster and was totally gifted with the PR   
I agree he seemed like a genius doing as well as he did with what Spaz left him, especially without Montel. But the issues Joe brought up are not to be brushed off, even despite his injury luck. 
I agree Jeff. We need to start using position neutral terminology
I agree lol I was just tossing out that garbage trope
I agree players are not good GMs. Idk if the Wilson wanting Olsen is true but it doesn’t matter, it was management who signed the check. I also just don’t have a ton of love for Pete “Establish the Run” Carroll.
I agree that bothered me too 
I agree that EPA can be (but not always) heavily weighted by play calling and coaching 
I agree that immediate post draft takes are usually terrible, but Allen was extremely unique as a project QB who turned out to be an MVP level player. Some say his success set QB draft strategies back considering how bad guys like Lance, Fields, and AR have failed 
I agree that’s best solution
I agree that’s fair as long as they’re on your bench 
I agree the US domestically could survive, though violence and discord would be even worse than now.  I think internationally it would be the end of the US as the de facto western world leader, and might lead to a policy resembling isolationism. 
I agree there needs to be more competition amongst ratings agencies to prevent conflict of interest, but as for how, I'm not sure. 
I agree wholeheartedly with all of that except swap Jeff and Drachman 
I agree with all of those things except 1 and 3
I agree with Arnade for the most part.  But your second thread says "In the early 2000s the rise of CDS made it easy to trade credit, formerly the domain of experts too. This ease of less sophisticated professional access to great power played a role in the GFC of 2008." which is basically Goodwin's point
I agree with Becker AFC > NFC, who doesn’t get helped by having one of the worst divisions in NFL history
"I agree with Becker on respecting the FLB process

But Caleb is truly The People’s FLB"
I agree with both
I agree with both of you
I agree with both of you. There’s really not much that can be done without blowing up the whole season schedule
I agree with Chan 
I agree with Emyr here
I agree with Joe 
I agree with Joe. In my industry it's a lot of large scale complex problems with no answer and it's a legit skill to figure out where to start and develop a plan, even when the finish line is months away.
I agree with literally every point you made, and still think that's about what replacement level spot up shooters do lmao
I agree with that last point tho
I agree with that. Doesn't mean it's a weightless influence
I agree with the majority of men. The line is at medium sized dog. 
I agree with you here but it’s not absurd at all, unlike the PV FV rule
I agree with you on Gronk but I picked having megatron and gates over a $3 WR and Gronk
I agree with you, it was a yikes for them
I agree, but I don't think better tailgating is the key to making people care more 
I agree, but I was wondering if actually being close to the industry would shed more insight 
i agree, but the polling about the protests/riots was before this incident of course
I agree. Keep him, the program is legit on the ups for the first time I can remember, might as well keep the momentum and ride the wave
I agree. Short term downside is none since Wentz was playing at NFL worst level. Long term upside is there. Only “downside” is sunk cost fallacy
I agree^. Re: McConnell’s powerful speech
I ain’t reading all that. Happy for you tho. 
I almost feel bad rooting for Ohtani to fail
I almost hope it's not virtualized yet because I don't trust the govt with virtual data security 
I almost wanna concede the bet right now
I already bet it with draftkings through my brother nvm
I already bet with Marcus. You missed out
I already got the money tho, yknow for the movie...
I already have the perfect name 
I already have the scar from my pool incident so it will be a double scar
I already refer to the Su-27 as a “Beefy Boi” so I think the table has been set just enough 
"I already tried to start fight club and all
I got was trouble from BC "
I also admit like 70% of swimming' appeal to me is the US's dominance
I also am impressed by Cruz' high school and college debate accolades. The dude was one of the best in the country for 8 years. Princeton has a trophy named after him.  
I also am not a soccer fan so I’m not used to picking a random team 3000+ miles away for a dumb reason
I also am quite confident the NBC audio was leaked on a schedule, and wasn't just randomly found and released 
I also am surprised at how much having a players MLB Showdown card springs them into my head
I also appreciate you giving a real answer
I also believe Hamas and the PIJ are extreme detriments to the Palestinian movement, due to their MO of targeting Israeli civilians with terror attacks. But they’re supported by most Palestinians, and they arrest/kill Palestinians who don’t support them.
I also believe social media and mass media has played a role in the mass shooting surge over the past 10 years
I also can imagine having to work with Liz T similarly can make one disillusioned with the progressives 
I also can think of JFS/ Al Nusra Hezbollah, PKK, Houthi / Ansar Allah, Turkistan Islamic Party...
I also can’t believe they snuck him twice on the goal line
I also cannot make the playoffs so I'm just supposed to sit here and not try to make my team better apparently
I also disagree with that
i also disagree with their WAR model a lot, but i wasnt gonna cross reference their article's numbers with basketballreference
i also discovered this enormous yikes from @Gonzaga Basketball 2021 March Madness Champs  during my search
I also don’t know half of them, so I went with just a final 4
I also don’t know who bitch this is
I also don’t think I’ve ever eaten AT a wing stop
I also don't feel too bad because most of my "predictions" are rehashing of arguments from 538, so if they be wrong, so be I. 
I also don't know if that stat includes total points allowed or only defensive / special teams points allowed 
I also don't really like superhero movies and that's like legit half of them
I also don't remember what she looks like...
i also dont think large swaths of the party are on board with "actually the US is doing the best in the world with corona" but this is the horse they've bet the house on
I also don't trust the Latinos to be able to protect us from the Moslems
I also downloaded bumble last night and immediately lost my phone, so I think that might be a sign :(
I also enjoy “wireback”
I also find it hysterical how Bernie has a huge gripe with superdelegates being unfair, and yet the only way he would win is getting superdelegates to vote against their own districts' majority vote. Additionally, Bernie succeeds significantly more in caucuses, which are far less democratic than primaries. 
I also golfed today ;) shot 44 on 9 after starting triple, double. Happy with how I played 
I also got hit in the neck with a hot brass cartridge from the dude next to me and it went down my shirt and it looks like I have a giant fucking hickey
I also guessed Fernando Rodney in one of those other squares lol
I also had a class with Marcus but we weren’t friends who hung out. Never would’ve thought that fast forwarding 10 years, his kid would be calling me his best friend 🥰
I also had no idea 
I also had no idea but apparently he first proposed the Big Bang theory
I also had to get a prostate exam
I also had to make up for Goodwins anti Americanism
I also hate Pete Carroll and both of the team's he's coached so perhaps I'm a tad biased here
I also hate the Italians 
I also have no idea how different cryptos work. Like are bitcoin and ethereum just two brands of the same thing?
I also have that problem 
I also haven’t had a root beer in like 5 years but if I had a fridge full of them, I think I’d reach for the Barq’s
i also haven’t seen the news 
I also hooked up with a milf in Galway 2 nights ago so that was interesting
I also hope Dray and KD get along. Idk why but I can see Dray's personality annoying KD a bit 
I also hope this absolutely destroys Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, et al careers 
I also just bought a 3 wood and golf polo so we’re making baby steps
I also just finished season 1 
I also just realized that set of fatigues is wrong 😕
I also just realized they’re puns of diagonally and nocturnally 
I also just worked hard for 2 hours straight, so I basically know what slavery is like
I also know they recently partnered with amazon, probably to do with the bit deal Darrow just mentioned. Don't know too much about it though 
i also lied i thought they did stereo hearts
I also like Bijan OPOY
I also like bookers chances (established national profile, minority, well spoken) but the experts are saying he’s not liberal enough and has all those Wall Street ties which will hurt him in the primary 
I also like the suit lengths in the photo,  left 3 got the modern mid thigh and right 3 have the 2000s long board shorts 
I also like to jizz on the enlisted
I also like when they limit winning probability to within <95%
I also liked managing with Emyr. But when we had to step up, we did so. 
I also liked Skip Bayless for similar reasons so maybe it's just me
I also love how that tweet immediately follows this gem:
I also love Nate Silver twitter dunks
I also love that they’re not even pretending CFB has anything to do with academics anymore #cardalewasright
I also love the series of back shoulder fades that y'all hate so much
I also make $36000 a year
I also own a lot of Delanie Walker and Marqise Lee 😢
I also played C&C like it was my job
I also prefer when people respond no instead of not answering, so that's this haha
I also read an interesting take on Superbad in that it’s the last movie EVER to capture “high school without smartphones”
I also read that (if you're serious about the game) you should wait until lvl 10 to evolve or power up, because the pokemon you catch get way stronger after level 10 
I also read that an incumbent MA senator has never lost, so history either way lol
I also read they used 5 man blocking on like 94% of their snaps, which after the first half seems so dumb to me
I also read they were gonna have admiral ackbar do the kamikaze attack, but they realized they didn’t wanna have a character named Ackbar do a suicide bomb
I also remember being in my WCT seminar and it was brought up and turned into a big discussion, and everybody was so passionate about it that our teacher was fascinated and just let the discussion run the course of the whole class. Best WCT class ever.
I also remember reading that. I think somebody said the #metoo thing was gonna hit the food celeb industry hard and everybody thought it was gonna be him
I also remember some shenanigans with dalbs and schwag and the RD...
I also remember the arena being cool at first but if you do that whole quest with the champions backstory and it turns out she’s like half vampire or something, then she just forfeits the final match
I also Replied to the wrong post
I also retain that he wouldn't have won the primaries if the media didn't gift him 95% of their coverage, all of it favorable 
I also said "BONESAW IS READY" and the entire floor started shrieking with laughter and some got up on their desks and started clapping
I also saw Faiz, Andrea, and Kayla on Saturday
I also saw my first moose today
I also saw Rotel Hwanda
I also saw something today about Messi having a $450MM / 4 year contract?!
I also spent all last night listening to these guys talk about their love of art and theatre and not once mention money, so clearly making good work matters more to them
I also stole a pro Israel sign from him senior year. He didn’t know who it was thank Adonai. He went actually insane trying to find it. 
I also subscribe to the idea that French cuisine is a style, not a menu
I also take a bit of vindictive delight in watching all the GOP pols who endorsed Trump now have to defend his blatant racism and continued bullshit. 
I also think fantasy and DFS peaked last year, inflating ratings, this year is closer to the true average 
I also think if there was a phenomenal player who was a proud socialist and tweeted about it, he should get in too
I also think it’s possible small towns can’t sustain legit nice restaurants, and the outbacks can afford to operate while also fitting that familiarity niche
I also think it's majorly a cultural thing though. Indians and Asians don't let their kids want to be actors and musicians
I also think keeper value should default base of draft value (if drafted) to completely avoid your last concern
I also think she is skeptical of the movement hijacking. Like imagine BLM got inundated with say a pro-Palestinian movement, and BLM was like no I’m fighting for black people, not something else entirely. 
I also think their lack of a better #2 pass catcher hurt a lot but that can be said of a lot of teams, so not an excuse per se. Just that most good teams have much better #2s (not the Pats)
I also think there was a tourney that year where tiger was so far ahead that Vegas closed the books on him
I also think we are significantly worse than our 6-6 record 
I also thought Goody was trolling 
I also thought gorgeous was the best of the four but it was a bit funky in a way that didn't quite fit. Lyrics were old taylor tho. Didn't like Call it what you want at all, but still better than look what you made me do. 
I also thought he made a great point about what joins all the demagogue supporters (like Trump fans) together is the hatred of an other, and the catharsis when your team bands together to crush an "other"
I also thought that lmao
I also totally see that side of the take 
I also tried for OBJ
I also used to love the command and conquer games
I also wait 30 minutes to reply to texts from girls, don't wanna seem too eager you know
I also wanna say fuck TikTok and fuck the CCP
I also was curious. Allegedly invented in SF in 1956, but nothing about the name. According to Wikipedia 
I also went to Sedona in January
I also will be gone for the next 2 weeks. Leaving for Thailand at midnight tn. V excited af 
I also will need a ride, either from Becker or whitebread 
I also wish I was perennially 9 years old
I also wish this didn’t happen
I also won $160 in a golf round today
I also wonder if there will be any palpable split in colleges' presentation of their environments (as either open or welcoming) so students will have the ability to cater their own preferences
I always enjoy @#JustFacts✅ live groupme-ing his hangouts with Marcus 
I always enjoy the expectations vs reality part of your stories
I always enjoy the rookie QB “oh I can dodge the lineman like I did in college” sobering realization
I always forget how damn big David West is
I always forget to never underestimate the FH incredible ability to disappoint me
I always liked him because he had hot-ish takes that he could articulately defend, shat on ESPN even while employed by them, and was good at poking holes in the common narratives. Contrast that with almost everyone else at ESPN and you can see the appeal. 
I always liked the US visiting uniforms
I always love Yglesias having to reap the hellhole of lib twitter asshattery that he sowed 
I always miss these jokes
I always say if I can predict a play before the snap, it’s probably a bad play
I always try to
I always try to be pacific 
I always try when it comes up on my IG. I’m like 25%
I always wanted to draft a fantasy basketball team with all the Mars, like demar derozan, Demarcus cousins, lamarcus Aldridge, demarre Carroll, and Marcus smart
I am 1000% serious about going to When We We’re Young Fest. I know Chan is too. Who else is? 
I am a center shill for the Schiller center
I am a consultant. My client is a bank. 
I am a Hunter believer 
I am a hypocrite and am pulling a becker. You may all throw shade
I am a moderately worried for Becker’s mental health
I am absolutely elated at that parallel thinking 
I am ahead of John
I am all in on the stethoscope boiz shitting on the lancet ladiez
I am also missing the reference
I am always here for Astros slander
I am always stunned by repeated poor clock management at the highest levels of football
I am appalled 
I am asking because looking if I only do 6 months (decision TBD). Becker I will miss yours regardless unfortunately, Jeff I would in theory be able to make yours
I am assuming Smith will be a ~T12 QB here on out, not a fucking MVP candidate like he's been so far...
I am available later, like 8:30-9 pm
I am aware Andrew. But like I said I hate being the guy who says he’s a 9 and shoots 90
I am aware but maps don’t always tell the full story
I am aware but you also can’t just discount them because they’ve been good for 20 years
I am aware. Brown was good last year. I don’t know why we traded him and drafted a new OT unless it was a major upgrade. Because there are big holes elsewhere
I am back in the gordo so I can do secret Santa whenever 
I am bustin for Justin rn
I am certainly enjoying the performances of KershLOL and GrandLOL of the LOLs AngeLOLs LOLgers
i am coming up blank, on the song and other artists
I am completely unaware of any such situation 
I am conflicted on if that guy should be gulag’d or applauded 
I am confused
I am confused to how Chan knows what you were wearing
I am considering applying for a masters program at Georgetown, so if that happens @#JustFacts✅ Id like to crash on your couch for 2 years
I am crine
I am curious how you had it playing out in your head
I am currently preparing for the Fuckhole open part 2 at Olympic @#JustFacts✅ 
I am doing my taxes and holy cow 2019 was a great year for asset growth 
I am down and I think Taylor and Brooke too
I am dying 
I am dying to know what “kellehering” is in that context
I am dying to know who bitch this is
I am elated
I am enjoying vicariously listening to these albums with you Mr Anal Artist
I am entertained but this is the opposite of the Sandwich Rule
I am extremely hesitant to say this, but I think Biden has this locked up
I am flabbergasted 
I am for giving extra money and attention to the best students, especially ones that come from poverty
I am free all weekend. I realize it is a 3 day weekend. Is anybody not free this weekend?
I am going to check all my future doctors’ IGs to make sure they’re not a lunatic
I am going to run a 5k right now. Thanks for motivating me
I am going to start killing people
I am gonna storm the Capitol with hurricane force winds  
I am graduating intel school today
I am happy that Ners has become fuckholes vernacular 
I am happy that Zay Flowers seems like an awesome and fun dude
I am happy with my trade
I am henceforth calling him “The Herb”
I am home on leave, and there are actually a lot of good movies out now
I am honored knowing joes last bit of income went to the Jacob Wohl video 
I am howling
I am howling
I am HOWLING
I am HOWLING
I am HOWLING
I am HOWLING
I am HOWLING
I am HOWLING
I am hurty 
I am in for the PKs any time and place
I am in on Next Gen Stats view
I am in Phoenix for the next month
I am in tears
I am in theory for making the US more business friendly, but in practice, I'm not sure exactly how that manifests.  I'm also generally skeptical of the success of job retraining programs, though they're good political points to make.  And I'm against federal infrastructure plans because they waste all their money and don't build anything (prefer state plans financed by the feds).  All of these fit cleanly under the umbrella of a small federal government
I am inclined to believe the Venn diagram of Trader Joe’s shoppers and mask wearers to be considerate / avoid getting confronted has a lot of overlap
I am increasingly confident that it’s a lock 
I am interested
I am interested in hearing more about your thoughts on college football parity
I am less than comfortably ahead and facing alshon in two leagues. My butthole will be doubly tight
I am listening to out of the woods now because tbh it doesn’t even ring a bell
I am literally crying
I am loving the public dumping on UCLA for getting smoked by UNM at home in an empty stadium to go to 0-3
I am MAD that I can’t discriminate against people for being gay anymore, and I am going to yell about it on twitter - 10,000 people apparently
I am mixed on that rule. I totally understand it, but I also wonder if it’s better to treat like a questionable designation for a MNF game, and you have to make the decision ahead of time 
I am nervously fascinated to see what happens with the next leaders of Russia and China. There is absolutely no guarantee that Putin’s and Xi’s successors are going to be anything like them. 
I am not a culinary prodigy 
I am not a fan of strawmen arguments.  And trust me I certainly wish people would prefer to vote out corrupt politicians, but Bob Menendes is going to win in NJ because he has a D next to his name.  But that falls on the voters, not on the system
I am not at liberty to say anything about the specific drone incident
I am not being convinced
I am not exercising my option on Ivory
I am not sure but I think I’m the same
I am obsessed with the CHAZ storyline
I am OFF team Becker after this week. Been nothing but loyal all season and all he does is try put me last in the power rankings and shit on my team for having small dicks. See ya later team Becker 
I am on house hunting leave until 31 Jan
I am one sportscenter IG post of a dog on a surfboard away from blowing a fucking gasket
I am pro anything that hurts china as long as it doesn’t hurt us more
I am pro getting the Ts out fwiw
I am proud 
I am proud of myself. Lowest salary of us all, nicest car. The military should be proud
I am proud of the FH for (largely) sticking to the hearts as the sole react emote
i am putting the Ivanka Goya tweet in a presentation tomorrow (customary last slide funny picture / meme), I don't expect to get reprimanded but its certainly a risk
I am quite aware. I know you know I follow these things closely
I am ready for the FH open baby
i am reminded of the Bill Burr SNL opener about white women
I am reupping my NBA draftee analogy because I think it’s very fitting
I am shaking with rage at this egregious error
I am slightly amused
I am so excited to the Bock Bauer Shootout
I am so firmly on the Charles side of the Charles-Shaq beef show
I am so happy
I am so in on When We Were Young Fest
I am so sad. I cannot find the video 
I am still baffled by that decision. Literally zero fantasy leagues end on the last day of the season. 
I am still playing Starcraft, thanks to the Thompsons, if anyone wants to join. I capped at Plat 2 with both Protoss and Zerg.
I am streaming on my phone because I also don’t have ACCNX 
I am stupid. I get it now. 
I am stupid. It would be different because of states with few people and 3 electoral votes 
I am super forgetful 
I am surprised by that result. But Marcus you ain’t winning this one
I am the arbitrator of the LOLs. But I am very happy they have become popular amongst the FH so I will allow it
I am the fantasy baseball champion
I am the greatest fantasy manager ever
I am there Jeffrey
I am too
I am trash
I am truly not able to go to Charleston 
I am unfamiliar with that term but I induce that it means orgasm face?
I am utterly baffled there are so many over the fencers. Before today, if you told me people unbuckled their pants every time before they pissed, I would have laughed in your face. 
I am very much looking forward to the 10 year reunion to hopefully catch up with all the people we used to see every day but have since completely forgotten about
I am very pro china tariffs
I am very sad
I am very sad the Niners lost 
I am with drachman tho that this isn’t something you should “couldn’t care less” about. This is very disturbing. 
I am working evenings during the week, unless y’all are willing to stay up late I cannot do weekdays 
"I am
Shaking with rage"
I am. A place for me to rent and live. I'm also saying if she wants to look at new places and you think she'd be interested in my current apartment, she could be the first one to see it since it's going on the market soon
I am. Fuck outta here hoe 
I announced my fandom before the season proof is in groupme baby
I apologies to KD for making her husband wake up angry
I apologize 100% of my brainpower is focused on the PKs
I apologize bengals 
I apologize for forgetting to lump in the Samoans, Fijians, Hawaiians, Tongans, Maori, etc who are definitely also in the same ethnic category as the aforementioned. 
I apologize for opening the floodgates 3 years ago
I appear to use the same first word as @Ass Ketchum and @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 
I appreciate that they know what their brand is and they’re owning it
I appreciate the skill soccer players have, but I fucking hate watching the games. I'd literally rather watch a practice
I arrive around then
I arrive Saturday morning. If you're feeling generous you could pick me up from the airport, or if you're not I could uber
I ask because a girl from my flight left today and another girl started bawling during the goodbye. And I was thinking that “oh that’s pretty normal” but I also could not for the life of me imagine a man doing that
I ask because after the debates, Chris face timed me and I answered and said why don't you just call? And I wasn't sure if I was the normal one or the weird one. 
I ask because I saw that Marvel commercial and was wondering if people still cared
I ask because I was watching YouTube vids on it and they get into protein structures and mRNA and stuff, and many scientists said it’s “not a complicated virus” which is part of why they were able to develop a vaccine so fast. And I was just wondering if y’all agree or have opinions or whatever 
I ask because Lisa Murkowski said she'd not support filling the vacancy because of the obvious double standard
I ask because there’s an airman in my shop who’s 19, and she didn’t know who nirvana was, and I was like holy shit I’m like a decade older than you. 
I asked jalen rose if he thought sage steele ever listened to clipse and baby
I asked Marcus for a good weekend to visit like 2 months ago and he revealed he actually hated us all
I asked who was commissioner last night and nobody answered. I don't know who commissioner is
I asked who you favored in the bet and you said something like “they’re both so lame that I can’t bring myself to care”
I assumed you meant he’d have a 50% shot if the pats lose
I ate indoors a bunch of times but that’s over now. Back to take out only 
I attempted to talk my boss about "wanting to learn more from him" yesterday. It did not go well... I was able to salvage by saying the reason I wanted to talk was because I was worried about my performance rating, and I kept harping on "I want to achieve maximum performance ratings". But yeah not gonna try that again lmao
I avoid the conversational cesspool that is Reddit politics
I banged the drum for that in 2018 so if we went through Jimmy and then 3 picks for Lance only to trade for Kirk in 2023, I’m gonna kill myself
I barely know either of you
I basically stopped playing. It was getting too passive for me. 
I beat a exeggcutor / gyarados gym this morning. Realized my memory of types and effectiveness is real rusty
I became a big fan of him when he fought and lost to Korean zombie back in 2012, because 1) it was a legendary fight and 2) he was so emotionally devastated when he lost and clearly cared so much that I wanted to root for him 
I been at the airport for 3 hours. Only 4 more to go
I been playing with this British guy who a month ago has never played a real course before. He’s far from good but he’s gotten 2-3 bogeys in like 4 rounds and is dying for his first par. 
I been saying that for 17 days now
I beg to differ. You Emyr certainly demonstrated your having of a heart during the last 5 NFL post seasons
I believe "guaranteed" was used at least once
I believe boxing was the default but we can make adjustments as needed
I believe he would agree we’ve both been transparent
I believe he would do interviews and say Tiger will be greatest golfer eve, but I don't think he'd try to start a shoe line, say he'd only be sponsored by X brand, "stay in your lane", etc etc. I mean let's be honest at this point Lavar Ball is doing a lot more than just supporting his kid 
I believe him though
I believe in goodwin. He’ll do the right thing 
I believe it because of my cousin. She said easily 12+ Mon-Sat, then like a light 8 on Sundays. 
I believe it's lambeaux
I believe it's that you're not allowed to deduct non-insurance covered mwdical bills 
I believe so. Otherwise it makes no sense
I believe that through these two tactics, I made more in profit than KyBocks entire Robin Hood career
I believe that's a condom filled with water?
I believe the answer is the square root
I believe the word is Miss Seuss
I believe there’s a full syringe that comes free with every adidas track suit
I believe they are alternating fast and slow
I believe this series of events so much more than AB’s story
I believe you Becker 
I believed what those people did too. On 9/16 I tweeted that Trumps campaign would end after he made a bunch of mind bogglingly stupid comments in the first debate. Silly me. 
I bet a significant number of kids never struck out
I bet becker dominates two truths and a lie 
I bet Becker thinks he’s a top 1% athlete after his +6 yesterday 
I bet Colts finish top 2 in AFC south
I bet he missed curfew or something
I bet he wouldn’t make it one term
I bet he's hoping to drop those charges like he dropped those passes
I bet if they replaced BMI with mile time, people would change their mind real quick
I bet it would come out. Becker bet he’d die
I bet Kevin does 
I bet Lapointes ex gf would be cool with it
I bet Latavius Murray won't be a top 8 running back
I bet Liberty University is the most greedy
I bet Luke Kuechly would pick Cam over Brady. Is he an idiot goody?
I bet McDermott would’ve loved your secret Santa gift 
I bet Moises Alou is OBJs favorite baseball player 
I bet neither Rojo or Lenny finish top 20
I bet outside of the top 15
I bet QBR and overall finish has a positive correlation
I bet several with him on the draft
I bet that's not all you're gonna hire them to do ;)
I bet the Broncos/Seahawks group chats that Russ isn’t in have sensational content 
I bet the rest are close to the 20-25 range
I bet under 4.5 QBs in the first round 
I bet we all have poorly-aged excited messages from back then…
I bet you could overthrow the Chinese government by cutting off the NBA to China and saying it was at the direction of Xi 
I bet you look both ways when crossing Coro
I bet you’ve never felt sexier finishing jerking off and immediately reaching for 10 donuts
I blame goodwin for infecting becker with this argument MO
I blame the CFP committee
I blame the parents
I blitz here
I bring it up because they all hung out (minus ray) on KGs show today and talked about it. And they all basically said I don't hate what he did, they hate how he did it. Totally ghosted them apparently. And of course you don't hear rays side since he's not there. But interesting to hear about it from the guys themselves for the first time really
I brought my work laptop home because if there's the slightest chance I can work from home on Monday, I'm not gonna miss it
I brought up the golf challenge because I shot a +1 on a back nine 2 days ago. Best 9 of my life
I burst out laughing at the Jordan Howard reference ;)
I buy coffee almost always, but I also use the shitty office machines, especially in my new office
I buy that the story is still great regardless of the ending, and that the subplot endings are all amazing (sorta like Elder Scrolls in this way), but the final final ending was super loose butthole
I cackled
I cackled at the vat of acid at the end lmao
I call him Preppy Ryan Tannehill
I call it Tapchat
"I call it the ""McKayla Maroney Fappening Denial"" strategy. 

""That's not me, but if it was, I was underage"""
I call it white elephant
I call that "The 2008 Matt Cain"
I call that arbitrage
I came 200 miles for this. It's happening when it's happening. 
I can accept it, but I prefer against it
I can accept that
I can accept that. Bernie voters don't have a strong need for intellectual consistency anyway
I can and have shot better but I also shot an 86 yesterday 
I can ask? I have no idea how hard it is for him to get tickets. Pretty sure it would only be in NYC tho
I can believe that the Rams beat the Saints in the 2018 NFC CG, while also acknowledging that the Saints got absolutely screwed
I can dig it. What about pickups cutoff week?
I can do 8 perfect pull ups, or about 57 crossfire pull ups
I can do it
I can do it but I would just fall back toward the mountain if I’m losing control
I can do Labor Day
I can fix her
I can get 2 wipes from 4 squares, after that I'm not risking it
I can get through a Jimmy Fallon monologue without laughing
I can hear arguments for golden eye or DK 64
I can hit 60% from FT. Obviously 3 is harder but it's not like it drops to like 5%
I can hit the corner 3 like 20% of the time 
I can imagine Patricia repeatedly saying “In New England we built a culture of winning by...” and Stafford internalizes that as “well fuck that place”
I can in theory take vacation whenever but who knows when/where that will be
I can never have too many pillows
"I can only guess, but:
1) I think she is distinguishing between cis women and trans women, and pushing back on the idea that “trans women are just women”
2) goody beat me to it"
I can only imagine Emyr’s disgust with you if/when he learns of this
I can only speak for myself but you might be overestimating how well people know the MCU 
I can only speak for the FH Open and that was exactly how it went 
I can only think of French Guyana, which might not count. Sometimes I see Filipinos spelled that way?
I can probably do Monday morning
I can probs do lunch
I can see cop lights down the road
I can see DET passing at QB. They would be setting one up to fail worse than Darnold at NYJ
I can see him playing a backfield receiver role effectively
I can see him saying “we are proudly the Washington Comanches, and what the FUCK are you gonna do about it”
I can see it goody, but I'm not sure why Wilson over Cam
I can see it John. Make your groupme a searchable or joinable group like on a forum site, toggle it to be public or private, then make the interface more ad friendly
I can see Jeff being low key real good since he would be prepared for fucking anything  
I can see Joe being a Northwestern man
I can see Mac Jones for you @Jamie Bourque. Wouldn’t say so out of the blue but now that you mention it.
I can see that argument, but I thought it was decent for the effort they put into it. Didn't try to do too much.
I can see that. dude was good for a long time on that Phillies roster, but overshadowed by cliff lee and halladay
I can see them take Sewell if he falls, or Waddle 
I can see this changing with more pass catching RB/slot hybrids (which unlike the 2QB system might actually happen in the next decade), but as of now, it’s a bad idea
I can see you on that but it all comes down to the music. And the music on TLOP isn't good, no matter how artistically brilliant Kanye claims it is
I can spot a scooby doo gif anywhere
I can still enjoy old Reese’s if I keep a positive TB12 mindset 
I can still name every player on the 2000 starting lineup. Fucking stacked
I can think of literally no better time
I can think of one. Went to all you can eat sushi, felt terrible all day, and around 3 pm it happened. That was like 8 years ago and I still remember it
I can totally see him saying that, then the suits say "Chris you don't have a choice". And he goes "oh yeah?"
I can work with that
I can zoom today or tm
I can’t believe dame keeps making these (tbh terrible decision) 40 foot threes in clutch time
I can’t believe he’s turned out as well as he has. Idk if it’s the Shanny system or him taking being a professional seriously but this is not the same fat slob that came out of bama
I can’t believe I know who you’re talking about lmfao
I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I think the Bears should put Mitch back in
I can’t believe John “52 degrees” Thompson would use something as environmentally damaging as a window AC unit
I can’t believe NBA season starts in like a month lol
I can’t believe the foodie ass fuckholes have never had a non-beef burger
I can’t believe the tiger king guy is actually the least dislikable character
I can’t believe they gave Cartman a 15 seed
I can’t believe this is happening
I can’t believe we didn’t mention the Kick Six
I can’t believe we’ve gone all day without a single OBJ reference in this groupme
I can’t decide what’s funniest of those. I think it’s #3 or #4
I can’t even take the Maye FLB smack talk seriously
I can’t fucking believe I lost both my RBs this week, and I have Saquon and CMC each in different leagues too
I can’t imagine calling a non-earth planet more habitable than earth lmao but I’ll let the telescope boiz do them
I can’t join this call
I can’t name them all, but I can mark a few 
I can’t pause 
I can’t put into words how insane it is that the president of the US is like 70% to have raped children and 90% to have enabled raping children, and everybody (myself included) is like “eh what are you gonna do?”
I can’t say I agree but I respect being the only one with this take and still dropping the “I win, case closed” victory lap
I can’t see a lot of messages. Like nothing between my comment “yeah I did once” and  “ya hotel Rwanda”
I can’t see that happening in today’s NFL. The owners would ruin that players career
I can’t stop thinking “wait this dude is the PRESIDENT?!”
I can’t take all the credit. I’m extraordinarily humble. 
I can’t tell if I should hate Texas or not 
I can’t think of a single Australian one
I can’t think of another situation similar to belichicks at all
I can’t think of any more
"I cannot believe how hot it is. I’m not a “so how’s the weather” to start a business call guy, but holy balls it’s just ridiculous. 

I’m working noon-11 right now so I mostly wake up, do some more settling-in shit in the morning, go to work, then go to bed. I did get a better room thank god. Gotta start getting into a better routine tho.

Work is a lot more classified than my old job with the F-16s so unfortunately I can’t talk a ton about it.

I’d say right now <50% chance I wanna stay for longer than 6 months "
I cannot believe I missed the greatest game ever
I cannot believe it but I think Danys storyline ending was the least bad
I cannot believe it but sport center had a good tweet
I cannot believe the dissonance here
I cannot believe this is real
I cannot do week nights so we need to play around that. I’m sorry
I cannot get enough of the Rovell content today
I cannot give less of a fuck about the barstool drama or deal or whatever. Please stop. 
I cannot go first half of march. So Feb 18 works for me and John but not Goodwin
I cannot handle his weirdness. I’ve never gotten the heebie jeebies from anybody else even close to the level I get from him. 
I cannot lose this week
I cannot put into words how excited I am 
I cannot put into words my embarrassment for america right now
I cannot read. I meant TX. And also you have SC blue
I cannot remember a worse one
I cannot see a downside of either of my propositions 
I cannot state how anti ceasefire I am
I cannot stop looking at the tricep fat in the Trigglypuff gif
I cannot think of a scenario in which this is an accident 
I cannot verify but watching 4 straight passes to the right makes me think it’s got legs
I cannot wait for the memes
I can't believe I did so poorly this year. I've never finished bottom half of any fantasy league before 
I can't believe it's not a parody hahaha
I can't believe she dates Pablo Sandoval
I can't believe the reigning AL Cy Young winner is the third best pitcher on his team
I can't believe you PAID $3!!! to conduct one of the worst trades ever
I can't believe you two don't want to pick something for week 17
I can't choose one for myself... this is tough  
I can't cross the bridge over the freeway back to my house because of the presidential motorcade which is passing through sometime in the next 30-45 minutes. Booooo Don
I can't do 16/17. Any time after that though
I can't do this or next weekend, but could do any time after that
I can't even name 10 soccer players so I literally cannot come up with an all star team
I can't find it on google maps
I can't get enough of the Trigglypuff lmao. Like 5% of me feels bad that she's gotten doxxed and her life is probably in shambles for the time being, but oh my god it's just too funny
I can't get over that video. It's the Stephen Wu music video of BJJ
I can't get through it 
I can't say I remember it being really bad?
I can't shake the feeling that next week, the "real" NFL (and therefore fantasy) begins
I can't tell if the voters can or can't see  the bullshit 
I can't think of a single scenario, however unlikely, that makes going for two there worth it
I can't think of anything that's not probability based
"I capitulated last year after Chase had the literal best rookie WR season of all
Time "
I certainly couldn’t last a full video tbh
"I changed kicker scoring to:
PAT 1
Missed PAT -1
FG 2/3/4 for 40/50/60
FG miss -1 for under 50

Please voice any approval or objections "
I changed Thomas to $30 (thanks for the correction). And added McKinnon, currently going as the RB43, for $10
I checked the comments of a House of Highlights post, and... lol
I Chief for the Speef 
I chuckled
I chuckled
I chuckled 
I commission tomorrow
I completely believe it, because teachers aren't paid according to ability, so they must be paid according to experience
I concede. @Boe Jourque I agree it’s a coup attempt. 
I concur with Becker that Fenway is mostly just historic. Maybe if you’re on the monster it’s awesome but I’ve never been. New yankee is a poor crossover of historic and new and accomplishes neither well. 
I confess I am not NOT upset
I consider my fandom as community service
I continue to be #1 hater of the homeless and crackheads
I continue to be a KD Stan
I continue to be moderately worried about Becker’s mental health
I continue to be shocked at the unprecedented swing in Latino preferences. Idk if it was the progressive movement, the protest/riots, the identity politics, some genius Trump messaging, or what... but the Democrats delay the Latino vote in historic numbers
I continue to be surrounded by haters
I continue to believe Terry is the most underrated WR in the league 
I continue to believe the Russians cannot and will not win the war on the ground. I don’t believe Putin is looking for an off ramp per se but idk how he’ll react to the reality that he cannot do what he hoped
I continue to think Andrew and Giovanna Becker are a very good bellwether for the national political state of mind 
I continue to think they don’t really have a strategic plan after the initial blitzkrieg failed. Seems to me they are trying to surround this Ukrainian force (possible but doesn’t seem imminent since they’re advancing so slowly), and see what happens from there. 
I continue to wonder how things might've played out differently if NBC released the grab her by the pussy tape in the primary 
I convinced Kathleen (that’s the gf name) to watch the office for the first time and it’s been a great experience 
I cook 0 times a week. I lose probably $4 a meal ordering instead of cooking. I can understand the sentiment, but also understand that it's not impossible if I wasn't lazy
I cook chicken, ground, beef, and lentils. I order burgers, salads, and chipotle
I could also replace “number of murders” with “number of shopping carts in the hallway”
I could be biased because I’ve started playing with my little brother last 2 weeks. Literally hadn’t swung a club in 2+ years. In 3 rounds, he hits 70%+ of his drives and irons solidly, if not particularly accurately. Zero lessons or practice or anything 
I could be down
I could be down for my Washington. Take the commute with Angela again
I could be down for war zone today so lemme know if y’all play
I could buy that take tho. That the chargers are the #2 afc team
I could in theory come and play Friday. But I’d need Marcus to bring my clubs back
I could luck into a home run 
I could make it to the nearest metro north
I could pass
I could probably hit you with a tennis ball from here
I could probably luck into a HR tho
I could see in the dark. That was the most useful thing ever. 
I could spread that shit on my bagels
I could’ve just texted that to Chan lol
I could’ve kept Josh Gordon. Wouldn’t have looked good until this past week, but I’d take him for $10 now
"I could’ve worn my thobe and everybody would think you’re cultural, mysterious and intriguing
"
I couldn’t find duroc and egg roll on the podcast app
I couldn't really give less of a fuck about the issue lol. I don't know about costs of insurance or anything, but if transgenders are receiving a disproportionate amount of funding per capita then that should at least be addressed. Also depends what MOS person is in. If they're an admin, idgaf. If they're in an infantry unit full of rednecks and it hurts camaraderie, maybe worth not having them in there, civil rights or not. 
I couldn't tell. You have technicuru difficurties 
I could've sworn the rain and the Chloe were the same day
I cried
I cried at the end of old yeller but it was still the right call
I currently just take the post workout whey protein everyone has. Thinking about adding a preworkout and something else. Do you recommend it darrow?
I currently live in east village. It’s expensive and small apartments, but it’s in the middle of fun zone. If I could pick again I’d probably choose upper east or west 
I deal with a daily report called "Reg on Leg" and I've been chuckling about it for weeks
I def logged the most time on the 360
I defend that today
I defer to @JustFacts✅ , mine might be too mean
I definitely watched it, but I don't really remember if that movie was good or not
I demand an add
I demand and expect an apology
I denounce the dodgers!
I deny your accusation!
I develop software that is used by  middle office data management in banks
I did both. Was disappointed almost every time
I did get dysentery a few days ago :(
I did get to check out one of these bad boys today
I did have a classic interaction today, I went to talk to a coworker who shares an office a 60 ish year old vet now works as a civilian. There was something that had the old squadron logo on it, and I said “haha just like the redskins”. Civilian boy overhears and goes into a fucking rant about how the name/logo is NOT RACIST!!! I let him go for like 5 mins and said “yeahhh I was just joking about how this logo isn’t used anymore”
I did I took it to an extreme. But the "fuck your method of protest thing" still applies. Again I don't think Kap is doing anything bad, I just don't have to like it
I did it guys 
I did laugh at Soul Food night at BC because they legit had a DJ and dance floor in addition to the fried chicken and okra, but AHANA did organize that whole deal so no prob
I did love it tho as a certified Drake hater
I did my T5 clearance prescreen interview today so hopefully I’ll start class on April 17
I did my taxes today 💪🏼
I did not
I did not do a good job planning lol
I did not know TSwizzle was back on Spotify
I did not lol
"I did not realize how awful the ACC was this week...
BC lol
GT lost to the citadel 
VT barely beat Furman
NC St lost to WVU by 17
Pitt lost to Penn St, opting to kick a FG  on the 1 yd line down 7 with 4 mins left
"
I did not. But Pat Lee and Brandon did so I heard from them. 
I did one of those Sandbox VR things over the holiday. Highly recommend, fun as hell. 
I did read an article that said that with these taxes Jeff Bezos could literally not pay his tax every year because he doesn’t have enough liquid capital. He’d be giving up like 1% of Amazon every year
I did read it. Read it while giving blood, but I'm going to complain because it's easier and more fun
I did see one Aldon Smith jersey lol
I did that a few months ago and accidentally hit Iran 
I did the keeper spreadsheet
I did the same but last Monday, all in the S&P. Thinking about doubling down
I did the whiskey thing last night and it helped but it hurts more this morning
I did think the spicy ketchup was overhyped. It’s like barely spicy. 
I did well under his methodology. Open book, note, laptop, etc for every assignment and exam. He also said that our exams will have problems we've never seen before, but we had the base knowledge to do it and had to apply it in new ways. I quite like that style of teaching 
I did. Incredible 
I didn’t actually sky it 300 feet upward
I didn’t because I didn’t want to be enraged
I didn’t change anything except that. No excess cardio or anything. Just started eating 1600 calories a day when I was probably eating 2500+ before dieting. Lost 10 pounds in 3 weeks, haven’t lost any strength.
I didn’t click but assuming that’s the gif where he slams josh Barnett head over heels?
I didn’t credit you. Hope you’re not mad
I didn’t cut and stain the wood in one day
I didn’t even give y’all enlisted jobs
I didn’t even know there was a season 3. Will def listen.
I didn’t even mention their god awful social media posts
I didn’t fuck despite the invitation. Being with dad hurts those prospects 
I didn’t fully process the transgender convo earlier. It’s just wild to me that “I don’t want to bang a transgender” is a cancel-able take in 2021. When we were seniors it would be everybody’s no-brainer answer
I didn’t get in trouble for my Ivanka Trump + Goya beans crossover event 
I didn’t hate the pick 
I didn’t have any personal beef with any of those guys except the twins and reposa. Just people who were either uniquely weird or just buttholes
I didn’t know Boston had a 3 Letter Agency office
I didn’t know leafeon but I searched “eon” and it popped up
I didn’t know they owned banana republic, gotta be purposeful that they kept that as basically an entirely separate brand 
I didn’t know Vinny was even a football fan. Let alone a eagles fan? mad about losing to the Seahawks? So he hates a first year seahawk?
I didn’t know who Lily Philips was and searched it smh
I didn’t know/remember he was the only player to win mvp in both leagues
I didn’t like the conversation about this not being a place for skimmers
I didn’t literally mean unbelievable. But lo and behold, it was in fact, unbelievable 
I didn’t love Halo 4 because I didn’t like the DMR as much as the BR. I’d say 3 > 4 > 2 in terms of personal enjoyment. But I know 1 and 2 were both revolutionary compared to other multiplayer games of their time. 
I didn’t make the lists. Think it was becker
I didn’t mean a general push left, I meant a push left within the Democratic Party specifically
I didn’t mention this earlier (other chat) but I love that Becker felt the need to specify I’m a smoker but not that I am the troops
I didn’t put anybody down as a reference yet 
I didn’t really like the Dylan storyline
I didn’t recall it so I went to YouTube and it came back immediately. Man that was a bop
I didn’t remember Chan’s address. But I could put in twin donuts and get there
I didn’t say tubular either
I didn’t see the Koepka heel turn coming 
I didn’t see the pick. Was it bad?
I didn’t see the targeting call earlier. Was that a good call?
I didn’t think so until you uninvited us all to your wedding
I didn’t touch the throttle so speed stayed the same. Just the stick which is just like a video game basically 
I didn’t watch enough OSU football this year but that would scare me about fields 
I didn’t watch queens gambit, is this is an accurate summary?
I didn’t win $25k
I didn't actually know the exact answer to this question when I asked it...
I didn't ask anybody if they wanted to go to the fight
I DIDNT ASK YOU
I didn't associate crab with crabs...
I didn't but I didn't get your joke so I looked it up lol
I didn't count Brooklyn 
I didn't do the research myself but apparently drives staring from the 30 actually have a marginally better average success rate than from the 40. 
I didn't even know about the whole Mazz thing at this point, hence the accidentally
I didn't even recognize him
I didn't even sin this weekend
I didn't explicitly say "without a fee" in my handwritten note
I didn't fuck over any poor people. I ENABLED other people to fuck over poor people 
i didnt know anybody in 8, 9 had ashe and arizona zervas (who i only know from that one radio hit), 10 white reaper, then i know aly & aj from like 15 years ago and absofacto.
I didn't know girls hated gwyneth Paltrow or Anne Hathaway
I didn't know that. I thought that was a td 
I didn't know that. Thought it was phased out by then
I didn't look at the picture go fuck your self
I didn't look that close lmao
I didn't mess it up, I redesigned it.  It was a cool pattern and you've probably since ruined it
I didn't name him hahaha
I didn't pay attention to like half the teams
I didn't really think to much on that, more that it's ridiculous to ignore every black player on the Pats because they're not a QB, and to insinuate that the Pats won't give a black QB a chance because they're black and not because they've had Bledsoe/Brady for 20 years
I didn't say I want to be part of it! I don't knowingly walk into a hornets nest
I didn't see no delay of game!
I didn't watch it because I literally bristle at his voice, but from what I'm reading, seems like the main contents were how awful everything is in America today, and how Hillary is also awful
I didn't watch, but it appears to be exactly what you'd expect, and no different than anything he's done in the past. Not answering questions, saying the media is unfair, bragging about his victory, ranting like a 5 year old, etc etc. Only difference is this the stage was bigger and the recent news has raised more concerns.
I didn't. I'm glad I don't
I dig it. Tough to change the status quo but it makes a lot of sense
I disagree but it was certainly closer
I disagree Jeff. I understand being conservative, It’s better than being reckless. But scientists were saying for months now that it’s far far more likely it prevents infection and transmission than it does not, and yet that was the message we all received because it was “well intentioned” 
"I disagree that McCarthy is not the favorite. There is literally no other alternative. In fact I’d say a more centrist that gets some Dems is more likely than somebody more MAGA. 

These holdouts are just throwing a temper tantrum that will accomplish nothing. "
I disagree that the current system is that awful.  What happens when only rich people can afford to run their own campaigns
I disagree that the govt is more efficient than charities and other non-govt funds 
I disagree there. Yeah they show the average team, which is all analytics can show. If they tried to adjust the scales in the model I think they’d be doing more harm than good. It’s the coaches’ job to see the analytics and then make a decision with the personnel they have. 
I disagree with that but yeah that was absurdly excessive 
I disagree with that. If the reporting and research are good, site doesn't matter.
I disagree with the call on 4th there (twice)
I disagree with the implication that white is “auto default race” for everyone. Maybe at BC and grad school, but that’s not indicative of the country
I disagree with the last sentence but otherwise agree with this take
I disagree, I respect the move
I disagree. Apologies for being a moron 
I disagree. I think some are better than others. Though I agree that as a whole they are awful
I disagree. Terrorists aren't innocent. Ever. I think it comes more down to: are you okay with inflicting immeasurable suffering on guilty people but see no reward for the vast majority of them?
I disagree. The arguing is still fun. 
I dislike Elizabeth Warren because she's ridiculously far left, and is one of those "everything bad is the other person's fault" people.  I've learned to not trust anybody who is an extreme partisan.
I dislike her. At BC I always thought she was boring and just had no personality, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt because Katelynn is awesome so she must be just shy or something. After a while I got the vibe that she kind of enjoys being good looking while showing zero interest in being friendly with anyone. And when I watched the super bowl with her, every thing that came out of her mouth was an insult or a quip or something negative. 
I dislike PayPal because they charged me some hidden fee both times I used them, and they are impossible to unsubscribe from their emails.
I dislike that I know what this is
I dislike that when somebody brings up an example to be used to compare against a situation, the response is to equate to the situation. 
I dislike that you will have both Bell and OBJ next year as well
I dislike the "sleeve of individual tattoos" thing that's popular nowadays
I dislike these car and insurance companies advertising strategy of portraying themselves as part of your family and life journey
I dislike too much of American Idiot but I can acknowledge it’s one of the most classic pop punk albums of all time 
I do
I do appreciate their highlighting of why the PGA did this: kill LIV, save the  legal fee hemorrhaging, get all that juicy blood money under what they perceive to be their control
I do at home, but I don't with a roommate
I do buy the "conspiracy" theory that cosmo purposely gives bad relationship advice to keep women single and buying their magazines
I do feel like this is the make or break year for Dak tho. If he’s trash or even mediocre again, it might be time for the Cowboys to rebuild (again lol)
I do it for the fans
I do it for the fans 
I do know accenture used to recruit the hell out of engineering majors
I do love playing with becker tho because he’s very analytical about his shot selection and process, which is the opposite of how I am and need to do more of
I do my best to counter the just false coalition 
I do my swearing in on Thursday 
I do not buy the median income of <35 years old families is $11k
I do not care if the person in front of me reclines. Idk what the big fuss is. 
I do not get it
I do not own a onesie
I do not think that guy is Asian 
I do remember him being a big player recruiter which was awesome but I didn't hear anything about issues with his playing time during the season
I do see the difference. Idk how you don’t see the similarities.
I do standard file through the IRS, not turbo tax or any of those services 
I do that sometimes when I wake up hung over
I do that too
I do think Apples products are better. But it does suck how they purposely obsolete the not-latest product to force its users to upgrade
I do think it would be different if Porzingis was actually heard of before the draft
I do think Kyrie Irving is disrespecting Ptolemy on at least one subject 
I do think she’s changed to be more like him than he has
I do wish I bought bitcoin a few months ago. Joe remember talking about it in the car on the way to golf? Should’ve pulled the trigger then
I do wonder what the past heroes of civil/human right movements would say about today’s civil rights movements
I do wordle and the other 2 NYT Crossword games, waffle, and heardle sometimes
I don’t 
I don’t actually know that but I assume there’s avatar blue people porn
I don’t agree with PFF. Their grade is marketed as a grade that means everything
I don’t believe that’s real
I don’t believe this. Ain’t no way MVS, Mason Tipton and whoever bum are getting the most separation in the league. 
I don’t believe you
I don’t bet against BC sorry but I’m sure becker will take that
I don’t buy the first part but can buy the second part
I don’t buy the jags taking jeanty 
I don’t care about mods because I never post or comment, but my god their incessant bitching has made me dislike them a lot. 
I don’t care lol. I have no clue how much leg is required to kick a ball 40 yards
I don’t care. He gets the job done
I don’t care. I’m ALL IN BABY
I don’t care. Joke 8 man league
I don’t chase em I replace em
I don’t consider guys like wilt and bill Russell but I can hear the argument be made
I don’t consider Thursday a primetime game
I don’t disagree but the biggest factor to me is how much you care about being interested in your work, not just in the present but for the rest of your life
I don’t disagree with any of that except that I don’t think I’ve ever seen him on a >360 yard par 4. They’re usually like 320 or less
I don’t even hate the playoff but I don’t think it’s better than the 4 team
I don’t even know what to expect 
I don’t even know what Uighur food is
I don’t even know why Marcus singled out Justin Herbert of all people but I’m all here for it
I don’t even mind them pumping WNBA because it’s actually sports
I don’t even remember exactly. One time you brought up reading a long form about Chrissy teigen and clearly something about that was funny to me since I remembered sorta 
I don’t even remember what the characters name was. I remember Anthony Anderson was Lewis
I don’t even remember when/where the claim was made
I don’t exactly remember the reaction at the time, but it sure seemed like none of the other players were indignant about the steroid use, since like 80% of them were on it too. Total opposite of this whole ordeal
I don’t fault teams for incorrect player evaluation. I do fault them for making bad macro decisions.
I don’t feel bad for any of them
I don’t feel like shit after eating dominos 
I don’t find out until after OTS. They choose for me.
I don’t fucking get it
I don’t fully understand the question?
I don’t get it
I don’t get it. I haven’t seen a bot post in years 
I don’t get service enough to talk about it until now 
I don’t get the ⛺️ thing
I don’t get the bus meme
I don’t get the strategy?
I don’t get this from WAS’s perspective
I don’t give two shits about the bachelor but zero sum game means anybody’s gain had to be somebody else’s loss
I don’t hate being Dennis but I don’t think the reasons are accurate
I don’t hate it it’s just super blocky and clunky, which I get was the style in the 60s when it was adopted
I don’t hate it. OT never bad especially with our shiny new QB
I don’t hate lock he’s just absolute fucking garbage
I don’t have a clue who y’all are talking anout
I don’t have a damn clue what Conor is saying lmaoooo
I don’t have a fogo in my entire state
I don’t have a fucking clue
I don’t have a horse in this race. Republicans could pull kavanaugh and confirm Barrett easily. But like if it’s a smear campaign to destroy somebody’s life, and it’s false, that’s fucked up yo
I don’t have a huge issue with the NIL stuff. It sucks for the coaches but eh whatever they’re making millions too. The conference realignment crap still pisses me off 1000x more. And understand they’re related but they’re different
I don’t have a minute by minute itinerary planned, just setting expectations 
I don’t have all the answers. I’m just strongly anti ceasefire
I don’t have any insight more than just parroting the 538 podcast, which has been saying anything is possible.
I don’t have time, making masks for the base
I don’t know any “bad” naming stories
I don’t know any protocol or anything but I wouldn’t have resuscitated him. It says it right there lol
I don’t know boxing, but I feel like fury is the Cain Velasquez of boxing
I don’t know but there’s no snow on the ground
I don’t know either of them well enough but I could buy that
I don’t know goodwin calculated them
I don’t know her IG
I don’t know him personally just a fantasy analyst that I like
I don’t know how I got “sees himself as an alpha” or “may coerce women into sex in nefarious ways” @#JustFacts✅ explain yourself 
I don’t know how to give hearts on IG 
I don’t know how you can say the same fanbase that made the show the biggest show of all time also decided to turn tail and shit on that very show they had been so invested in, just because l
I don’t know if this is based on exit polls or what, but super interesante 
I don’t know the odds lol. I don’t feel strongly one way or another
I don’t know this kid but that is an all time quote
I don’t know what half these Pokémon are so I’ll defer to the masters 
I don’t know what NoBo is
I don’t know what Texas NY or  Missouri mean
I don’t know what the auction values in the draft lobby will be, but I bet it’s not Rodgers for $10
I don’t know what the endgame looks like
I don’t know what to do
I don’t know what’s more impressive: 0-16 in a season or 1-31 in back to back seasons
I don’t know who bitch this is
I don’t know yet I’m just showing up tomorrow
I don’t know. I think a forever war is more likely than a withdrawal. But i don’t think the Russians planned for this and are trying to figure it out on the fly 
I don’t know. It’s a very important base tho
I don’t like having the rep as the horniest FH
I don’t like how half the top 30 players are gone before draft day. Less so, but I don’t like how most of the best keepers aren’t draft snipes, but rather lucky waiver pickups.
I don’t like John as Andy
I don’t like swinging at first pitch with starters, ok with relievers
I don’t like the animal style fries but yeah double double animal style, or a 3x3 or 4x4 if you’re feeling extra beefy
I don’t like Tillerson being fired at all. He was one of the only level headed guys in the White House and he obviously had a very important job. Fingers crossed Pompeo follows suit and doesn’t kiss Trumps ass
I don’t love the white bolt on the yellow thighs or the helmet numbers, but otherwise these are dope
I don’t mean that with political slight, but if giant outdoor concerts were held instead, I’d gotta imagine it would be a significant role player
I don’t mind the weirdness. I put silence of the lambs in my top 5. But it was just kinda pointless and tried to pass weirdness (aka fishsex) as excitement
I don’t not regret it, given the Pandora’s box that I opened…
I don’t play those bougie ass sports like tennis. G2g tho gotta make my tee time in 30
I don’t play WoW, but I swear it is the most efficient market economy of all time with real supply and demand swings that vary across different servers and should be legitimately studied by micro economists 
I don’t prepare comments. They come to me naturally 
I don’t really remember But I think they use a phone booth the most
I don’t really remember. Alcohol and girl problems probably. 
I don’t really thirst on IG. Maybe I should 🤔 
I don’t recall but this sounds accurate 
I don’t recall exactly. I use a lot of words to describe him being a butthead
I don’t regret a thing
I don’t remember “durak”?
I don’t remember either
I don’t remember exactly but I think I did a bit
I don’t remember mine. Emyr was D’Emyr
I don’t remember the exact context but at one point we planned on doing the FH Open Golf Event and Becker had a conflict, so we got mad at him and he got mad back. It was a whole thing. 
I don’t remember what Tonks was good at but def the other 4
I don’t reveal my sources
I don’t take Shaq in today’s game 
I don’t think about my wins over you at all. And even if I did, it’s too many to count 
I don’t think anybody doubts Trump would overturn the election in a heartbeat if he could. So call it a coup or not, idc about the actual terminology. But this “coup attempt” compared to every other one in history is... not the same. 
I don’t think anybody here is not breaking 6
I don’t think anything can beat Mr Unlimited
I don’t think BC has more than other power 5 schools
I don’t think conservatives are over criticized. I do think liberals are under-criticized
I don’t think he returns to the ravens. Seems like his choice to represent himself led to him being offended during the negotiations
I don’t think he’s gonna leave The Land
I don’t think he’s in the stadium?
I don’t think I could score a TD. Any defender lays a finger on me and I’ll go flying
I don’t think I ever noticed @goodybot pic until now
I don’t think I’ve ever felt more normal about this group
I don’t think I’ve ever had a mixed meat burger 
I don’t think I’ve ever had a take age as well as Elon to the Gulag
I don’t think I’ve ever heard Kevin called “Kev” before
I don’t think I’ve ever once seen anybody use the Bourque kitchen 
I don’t think I’ve had fruity pebbles since the last time I stole jeffs  
I don’t think I’ve listened to a Kanye song more than a few times through the album since Yeezus, which I havent listened to since college
I don’t think it would increase it. I actually am curious at the % of registered voters who don’t vote 
I don’t think it’s dying. It’s never been more popular amongst the boomers 
"I don’t think it’s possible for Russia to win this war. I cannot see any way they accomplish their strategic goals (i.e. a vassal state of Ukraine), and I am increasingly convinced it cannot win militarily either. Their ground force problems in maintenance and logistics are not getting better. Their Air Force problems (lack of PGMs, airspace deconfliction, targeting, BDA) are just getting exposed. They lost 9(!) aircraft yesterday, including allegedly 2x Su-34s (their best fighter bombers). 

Even if their major operational problems are overcome and they pummel Ukrainian cities into submission, I doubt they have the manpower, morale, and supply to hold them against a hostile populace."
I don’t think Jeff realizes what a client is
I don’t think so because he’s a civilian 
I don’t think so. Just that if your tee shot is used then the other guy has to hit the next shot. And I think there’s a few special rules holes like scrambles 
I don’t think so. On one hand, it’s important to maintain chain of command, and the Capt prob knew that as I said before. But, this is uncharted waters (heh) and you don’t want to establish a culture of punishing those who look out for their troops above all else.
I don’t think that’s a foul
I don’t think that’s it because it’s more of an unintentional power fade, not a disgusting slice. And I tried closing the face at the range and it wasn’t it
I don’t think the Pats planned on drafting Fat Fucking Mac at 15 but I like that they did, even if it doesn’t pan out 
I don’t think the Steelers are fraudulent? They have a top 5 defense and a solid offense. Lucky to be 8-0 for sure but tough to not call them a top 5 team
I don’t think there is
I don’t think there will be much rioting
I don’t think they did it to tank. I think they’re just donkeys. Maybe wanted to finish the game with a sack
I don’t think they have food, but I wouldn’t eat food from continental if you paid me
I don’t think they’ve been enumerated but the likelihood is player prop unders
I don’t think we ever discussed? $200 pool, say $140 to winner, $60 to second?
I don’t think we have one
I don’t think we need an FLB 5 either way, this has been electric already
I don’t think you can? But if you test again, the odds of it being a false positive drop from 1% to .01%, and .0001% a third test 
I don’t totally understand how the financial system works, but I trust that putting my money in the S&P500 for 40 years is probably a good idea
I don’t understand 
I don’t understand how college coaches can have such high highs and low lows
I don’t understand how Steph goes ice cold in the playoffs every year @Skimmer 
I don’t understand how vaccines work, but I trust that they’re probably a good idea
I don’t understand the Becker on Joe negging but I love it
I don’t understand this “new company” at all. Is it going to replace the tour? If not, what’s the point of it existing?
I don’t understand what the BoSox are doing
I don’t wanna be the judge of that. But it’s pretty undeniable there are lots of questionable holes that would glare under the microscope
I don’t wanna live in a world where All Too Well isn’t the winner
I don’t wanna talk about it
I don’t wear that ever tho
I don’t. My guess is they’re US military. 
I don't
I don't believe Don could break 85
I don't buy that story (yet)
I don't buy that tho. What are they supposed to not recruit other RBs?
I don't buy that. These guys have swung a bat 500,000 times, take batting practice like this every day, and all of a sudden 40 swings permanently changes your swing?
I don't care about 3, they already benefit the most. I care about 1 because I like free markets, but they might be alright anyway. I care most about 2 because they get nothing ever for their value, which is significant. 
I don't care, pay directly I guess, no need for a middleman
I don't care. Girls seem to fucking love it tho, so let them do what they want. 
I don't drink rye or Irish whiskey enough to have an opinion 
I don't even care that I don't get credit. I just hate doing everything while he just tells me what to do
I don't even know haha. A niners super bowl in 2017 is not even in the realm of consideration for me, so I'm thinking you cut the bad assets now
I don't expect to make lots of money but I do plan on living a frugal lifestyle for most of my life
I don't feel bad, because 1) I don't have any company loyalty, 2) the entire industry is like this, 3) the entire world is like this
I don't feel cheated by BC at all, but I do feel like they suppressed anything that wasn't convenient for the administration. Whether or not it is warranted is a different question, but as someone who tried to put on some small events to help the future student body, I ran into a lot of push back at every point and eventually gave up. 
I don't feel healthier
I don't get finance. I feel like so much of what's behind the numbers is hot air
i dont get it
I don't get it except that it's a mediocre pun?
I don't get it?
I don't get it?
I don't get the Mario chalmers joke?
i dont get the shirley temples?
I don't get the Tatiana joke
I don't get who the current rule is trying to benefit though? I mean I guess the NCAA as compared to no rule, but it sure seemed like college hoops were fine before...
I don't get why you wouldn't want to share your best highlights, so people are more interested in watching in the future...
I don't hate BofA. They have ATMs everywhere, that's all I need
i dont hate candy corn but i never have more than like 4 of them
I don't hate it
I dont have a choice hahahaha
I don't have a solution that isn't a big middle finger to the poorest of the poor. But I don't see how covering everyone through this coop system is going to happen. Single payer is socialism and would be equally as bad. Perhaps you do Obamacare, but allow insurance companies to say no due to preexisting conditions? Then have a program specifically for those people?
I don't have a solution, nobody does... but understanding the facts are important
I don't have an answer to how valid answers under torture would be. I'd like to imagine that the intel ops people would have a good idea of the whole situation, and know what is plausible vs BS, what rumors could be true and what wouldn't. If you torture 10000 people and 100 say the same thing, perhaps there is something there
I don't have an online account with TWC sorry bruh
I don't know about civilians, but most (all but Kurdistan/Rojava really) spokesmen for the combatant groups are anti western. SAA and most/all Rebel groups for sure hate the US/Coalition
I don't know and I hope to never know
I don't know dick about engineering lol. Just that it uses math. I used to like math. 
I don't know how this relates,  but it does somehow
I don't know if I'm coming yet or not. Don't want to respond in the affirmative or the negative, because that might make me a liar. 
I don't know modern music for shit
I don't know much about her either other that what John said. She's also vocal about Republicans being her enemies, which is awesome for the social unity that our country desperately needs 
I don't know much about the residency structure, but if everybody agrees there should be more doctors, and residencies are the constraint, then something needs to be done about that on a macro level
I don't know proper procedure for doing so
I don't know shit about tennis, but I thought Pete Sampras was supposed to be the guy 
I don't know that kid but lol tin foil hat
I don't know what price is right tiebreaker is
I don't know what the pros and cons are of anything energy related so I don't have an opinion
I dont know whether to be happy because fuck ESPN, or to be sad because really Cuban come on man
I don't know whether to be impressed or weirded out 
I don't know who that girl is but the "- Andrea Ponder, SHRM-CP" is hilarious 
I don't know, but if that's true, it means all 3 massive regulating agencies were effectively bribed. 
I don't know, he changed his campaign promises every 5 minutes, except The Wall and withdraw the ME. He has done neither, thankfully
I don't know... it's so mysterious
I don't know?
I don't know? I would expect that it's going to be more popular than the newark card, but I could be wrong
I don't like disrespecting the flag and the anthem, while wearing pigs with wings socks and also saying "everything is all rigged anyway voting is pointless"
I don't like giving a team 4 down territory knowing they're down. It puts a huge advantage on having the ball second, much more than the current advantage of starting with the ball
I don't like it. Dude can't have it both ways. It's not like marshawn who is anti media consistently. He wants all the attention in the buildup, then acts like a child when he gets it in an unfavorable situation. He says he wants to be a role model, then is a huge sore loser.
I don't like that sentiment, even though it's largely true
I don't like that the sell price is lower than the keep price. Somebody else shouldn't be able to get your player for less than you (without having all potential buyers aware of such a deal)
I don't like the AHCA, but I like the democrat reactions even less.
I don't like the jamaal Charles situation where he's drafted high, injury, dropped, and then re-bid as waiver
I don't like them, it would make ground and pound way less exciting
I don't make excuses
I don't mind the #meowsternbias shit since I roll my eyes at most of their tweets anyway. But I just wanna see AJ Black get angry. He's by far the worst. 
I don't necessarily want to jerk off to her naked, I just want to see her in a hot nude scene, like the one from True Detective
I don't on purpose but it happens usually at 10-10:30 because breakfast and coffee, and at 2:30-3 because of lunch. Maybe after I get home instead.  And that's usually it per day. 
"I don't quite get the coin flip fiasco either (second #CoinFlipGate of 2016 already?!). From what I understand it stems from weird rules specific to the Democratic Iowa Caucus. Each candidate requires a minimum % to be considered eligible, and so if you wanted to vote Omalley, you have to change your vote. Since caucuses vote by ""I stand with"" statements, the final vote is the only vote that matters. The number of voters in the room at the beginning and end of a caucus differed in a number of precincts, so they had to flip coins to decide that missing group's vote. I thiiiiink that's mostly accurate on why there were coin flips at all. 

The fact that Hillary won 6/6 of them is hysterical. I am skeptical of any conspiracy claims, but still it raises eyebrows for sure. "
I don't quite see where LBs would fit, rather have a DE
I don't really care about saving either. Like 3/10 on the care scale
I don't really have much to say that's different than what you have already said. The principle is unamerican and the execution was horrible. Trump has made the US a pariah to the world, and it's only been 10 days
I don't really know if you're visiting, but I'm sure exceptions are made. That is if you're not kidnapped and killed on video
i dont really remember, i think i used achmed a lot
I don't remember saying that... Well its screen shotted, guess I must've said it
I don't remember the KD bet 
I don't remember the name of the lake, but it was Nova Scotia
I don't remember what that is. Do explain?
I don't remember what was special about Freeman?
I don't remember? I just remember you wouldn't restock your supplies and ammo
I don't see how a loss here does us any good, and on the contrary, a loss could hurt really hurt both short and long term
I don't see how it's not scalable. Or rather I think the same concept could be applied to localities across the country. Granted, they're not doing surgery or transplants or anything at these clinics. Nonpayers will always be a problem, but at the same time all of these prices are cheaper than an iPhone...
I don't see race. All souls are the same color
I don't smile at work. Why would I lie?
I DONT TAKE NAPS
I don't think anybody here is against having a conversation?
I don't think BB cares if their iPads or surfaces haha
I don't think Big Orange has ever said anything about student debt at all, even once. He'd have to watch an episode of Hannity to see what his position should be
I don't think he blew out his arm. He just lost 4-5 mph off his fastball, and got figured out (aka do not swing at anything until 2 strikes and he'll have 100 pitches by the 4th inning).
I don't think I could run that right now
I don't think I even know what "cheeky" means
I dont think I’ve ever participated but maybe cause we’ve never had one successfully?
I don't think it matters joe. 1 and 2 seeds are by division not points
I don't think I've ever heard "outreach". Sounds like a marketing thing
I don't think I've ever seen that before
I dont think so, more like Zack Greinke if I had to pick but not really a  comparison in any sport that comes to mind. Nobody else talks about their physics degree. 
I don't think so? it's more the McGregors and Rouseys (and a few years ago also GSP). Pretty sure the pay scale now is all about consecutive wins and title defenses, so Mighty Mouse is like the only guy making more than he "should". 
i dont think synergy has meaning
I don't think that was a humble brag
I dont think the browns actually had an 0-16 talent roster
I don't think there's any player in the NFL who does more with less
I don't think Trump would be the president elect today (or in 4 years) if McCain or Romney won 
I don't think you can call it a gaffe when he says it over and over again. But I do think if he said it a month ago, it wouldn't be nearly as big of a story
I don't think you heard him goodwin. Analytics and stats are for NERDS who have only seen the naked body through National Geographic, who sit at their desks and go DURR DURR DURR PYTHAGOREAN THEORUM
i dont tweet tho, i get myself in trouble in other ways
I don't understand the question?
i dont understand the toilet paper thing. i use like 1 roll a month. charmin of course
I don't use condoms when I watch porn or jerk off so idk wtf you're talking about Jeff 
I don't wanna hear you complain about anything fantasy
I don't want my girlfriend to be remotely interested in golf. That's something I wanna do with my male friends exclusively
I don't want to watch I want to play
I don't watch the full vid bruh you just have to see the ending or it's not worth it
I don't. It's Hollywood. It would be nice, but I don't actually much care
I doubt it, but you never know. If you have tech heavy software projects I'm good at that
I doubt there's ever been a 10 hearter
I drew brees 
I drink vodka waters because they get you drunk and hydrated at the same time
I dropped “it don’t get no better than solid baby” on Monday. Crickets 
I dunno, but somehow he underperformed Jim Thomsula
I dunno. Remember when that XFL team tried to get that female RB a TD with dive plays? I imagine it’s like that
I dunno. Same question as Chris.
I eat more deli sandwiches than char cutlery so that’s altering mine 
I end my project in 2 weeks. My task until then is: document everything. It's the most tedious shit ever
I enjoy Becker's love of 8 mile
I enjoy how the NYC sports teams all have such different personalities 
I enjoy it
I enjoy Sum 41
I enjoy that he alternates between bitch ass n word and bitch ass cracker  
I enjoy that the champions league was yesterday and wasn’t mentioned in here at all
I enjoy that this has the clippers at the bottom 
i enjoy the conspiracy theory that wentz and prince harry secretly switched lives
I enjoy the highlights but I don't actively care
I enjoy when barbers ask if I got that thang oiled down
I enjoy when r/wsb has their weekly moment of clarity and admits that they have no idea what they’re doing and it’s just straight up gambling
I enjoyed the joke 
I enjoyed this detail
I especially enjoy how neutrally he tells the story. Like history has painted Germany as the bad guys in WWI and he tells it in ways that really take in their perspective equally
I exclaimed
I exclaimed and the airport bar all looked at me weird
I expect a personalized “where to live” guide within the month
I expect so, but think they'd release it on a schedule even if this dirt didn't come out
I expect the Public opinion of the police has hit the tubes 
I expect to come back right around 1 Aug
I expect weekend golf trips with the DC elite 
I expected him to go 12 at latest. Once he hit 20 it was free fall
I expected the 9 on the zoom to be in and specifically tagged them on groupme. Then becker opted out, and drachman and Marcus opted in. There was a reason I didn’t tag Marcus
I expected the Andrew Becker Rightward Movement to be a leisurely jog, not an all out sprint 
I fear this is one of them well-intentioned ideas where execution must be perfect or the result backfires things
i feel attacked
I feel attacked
I feel attacked
I feel dread. 
I feel for Joe and John. Being up <30 and facing a QB on Monday night is the worst feeling in fantasy
I feel great 👍🏼 
I feel like “how do they ever miss the fairway?!” is a good analogy to “how do they ever miss the net on a PK?!”
I feel like >60% of people eat non-stuffed stuffing 
i feel like 35+ is starting to push it
i feel like a brand new freshman getting dinner at Mac, just excited to get a Trey
I feel like a lot of older, mediocre QBs who stuck around forever could be very good. Guys like Blaine Gabbert or Alex Smith. 
I feel like AIM was integral to social media but it's totally overlooked
I feel like Allen Robinson is a legit chance
I feel like Ash after he caught his first cater pie
I feel like BC is trying to do too many things at once and therefore is doing none of them as well as they could/should
I feel like Chan and Emz do
I feel like Dan Campbell was once a wrestling coach
I feel like dugtrio would be a pass defending liability
I feel like even at 41, Allen would be the equivalent of a replacement level spot up shooter, plus experience
I feel like every live band plays about 80% the same songs 
I feel like every time Alabama wins the nation just kind of shrugs their shoulders
i feel like everybody our age should get through 6 with the possibility that you dont know anybody on 4
I feel like Harry Reid nuking the filibuster in 2013 which caused the end of Roe v Wade in less than a decade
I feel like having the topping fries is BS. Too much about the topping, not the fry
I feel like his departure is a black mark but not anything else. If he didn't leave, it wouldn't be an issue. 
I feel like his stardom is too high to risk Khabib or Tony Ferguson right now
I feel like I can't breathe and freak out very quickly. And that wasn't after the gym
I feel like I should know what you're talking about but I don't 
I feel like I was a better skier at 15? Weighed less, joints weren't as sore after, could ski for hours and hours...
I feel like I watched most Giants games so got more exposure to them
I feel like if you choose not to eat it, you don't like dessert as much as those who do
I feel like I'm eating a puff pastry with all these flakes around. 
I feel like just knowing the CBA in the NBA puts you in the top 50% of GMs already
I feel like kitchen items for women are like hats for men. They all do the same thing, but we just like having multiple 
I feel like most lawyers voices are closer to Kermit the Frog than they are to Emyr
I feel like people who go to wineries are wear a blazer everywhere kind of people
I feel like physician loan rates have to be lower than gen pop
I feel like redzone has been nothing but interceptions
I feel like Stanley in “did I stutter” when he’s like “every day you say something stupider than the day before, and I think there’s no way you can top it this time, but you go and top it”
I feel like that could be a better way to go with the super shitty quarter-ply thin TP that otherwise requires like 6 folds
I feel like that could be a good first step
I feel like that happens all the time now and there's no problem. But if there's some mentally unstable dude who puts on a dress and goes to the girls room, I can see how people wouldn't want that...
I feel like that’s not the comeback you think it is
I feel like the 3rd hitter would take one just on principle 
I feel like the rift between black feminism and white feminism is as big as the rift between white feminism and white patriarchy
I feel like the success rate of 2 or conversions has dropped 
I feel like the thumbs down is way more biting than a middle finger
I feel like the 🐩 list started targeting me toward the end there...
I feel like there has to be a “on a team sports caveat
I feel like these questions aren't meant for you to get the right answer, but just to see how you think 
I feel like they’d be incredible lays 
I feel like they've been wanting to write that article for years and used the Brissett situation as an excuse to push it through 
I feel like this bet is confusing “elite” with “perfect”
I feel like this is still the truth?
I feel like this isn’t the year to be historically bad
I feel like when betting against the spread, people often overestimate the effect of the spread
I feel so bad for him watching this shit. He's up here sweating and looks like he's ok the verge of tears, all because somebody intentionally ruined the best day of his life.
I feel so bad for Luck 
I feel so validated
I feel the need to post the Don tweets so you can re-read them in all their glory
I feel the pressure when I’m playing $1 a hole match play and have to keep a lead
I feel vindicated
I feel zero bad for him. You knew what you were getting when you hopped on the train
i figured that they were the riches, and civil wars are for the poors, so they just went on vacation until it blew over
I figured the spladle and banana split were slightly too advanced
I figured you were a med school amigo but I learned you were an accountant or some shit recently
I figured you wouldn’t get on a plane to Rwanda for a tinder date 
I file this under the Nationwide Super Bowl Ad Category of “tweet intentionally so bad it’s designed to get interaction”
I filled mine out earlier today when I asked
I finished it. Waiting for goody to give me his email so he can post it
I finished Main Quest, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Fighters Guild. Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild were by far my favorite
"I finished serial season 3 this morning. Glad I listened but I sorta get annoyed by Sarah Koenig for some reason, not sure why. Some thoughts:
- I cannot believe there is zero tracking system for the judicial system but also not surprised at all, because it’s the government
- Those last 2 episodes about the gang violence in juvenile prison are rough, and it puts everybody from guards to inmates in impossible situations 
- There was one line from the guy Jesse at the end of episode 6 where a sympathetic cop was saying Jesse’s life got turned upside down when his brother was killed, and Jesse said no fuck that I did bad stuff because he wanted to be a gangster, and that was an interesting justification of perspectives"
I finished that 3 weeks into quarantine. Honestly the story got kinda repetitive 
I fkn hate this new iPhone commercial 
I for one am expecting to be set up with one of Marcus’s hot female interns
I for one don’t think John’s IGs are that weird
I for one have never bought into the hype of a big athletic white QB transferring from a bigger name program
I for one have personally witnessed Kevin wearing pants that don’t have giant pee stains at the crotch, so I’m inclined to believe it’s a troll
I for one want to see more FH athleticism power rankings
I for one would never claim a player with just one MVP is top 4 all time
I forbid you to resign
I forced her to take birth control in front of me
I forgot Aldon Smith was back in the league 
I forgot during the add Vinny discourse that he didn’t invite any of y’all to his wedding and goodys 🐐 troll about it
I forgot he was on the pats 
I forgot how bad his shit was
I forgot how ugly everyone is
I forgot if svana was in the picture junior year?
I forgot playoffs are only top 4 in this league
I forgot she existed lol
I FORGOT THAT HAPPENED
I forgot that movie existed
I forgot which team, might’ve been the lions with golden tate, but they traded him for a 5th rounder with a year left, when they literally would’ve gotten a 5th round comp pick if he walked
I forgot you don't pluralize pastry you barbarian 
I found it very interesting that the aforementioned religion question is a big split, then education and Catholicism (or rather not-Protestantism) brings it back to center
I found out I’m gonna be on an F16 squadron so that’s pretty cool. And yes I will be allowed to fly in an F16 at least once
I frequently forget Becker’s first name is Andrew 
I fucking hate conspiracy theorists haha
I fucking hate Golden Tate man
I fucking hate Zo
I fucking love woke offs
I gave an intel brief to Seth moulton today
I generally don’t like personal anecdotes but having a D1 program was a must have in my applications 
I generally think blocking websites is pointless
I genuinely am not sure
I genuinely don’t know lol
I genuinely struggle to think of places I’d rather lay my bare ass than a mod shower floor
I genuinely think hes lost himself tens of millions of dollars this series
I genuinely think it will for football 
I genuinely think the number of live WNBA minutes I’ve watched is under 5
I get $2400 a month in housing allowance 
I get 2 weeks of paid lodging 
I get 3 weeks off. I visit home twice a year, that's 2 weeks. Then I have 5 days that I take days off here and there, like for the Monday after the super bowl 
I get a new assignment toward end of 2022, and that will take me until 2025. The quality of that assignment and opportunities from there will determine if I stick it out or try find another gig. I am thinking about trying to go to grad school on the military’s dime, but that would require an additional 3 year tour on the back of that
I get flustered when something looks so easy but I suck
I get her request for an exception, and I doubt anyone would be mad at BC for granting it. But her reaction and tone in that article was so off putting. Completely different to say "Please reconsider, it would mean a lot to my mother and me" as opposed to "You Jesuits are frauds and jerks because you didn't grant my exception"
I get it
I get it but we need to make some probability based decisions here
I get it I just don’t get why it wouldn’t be fun to a 13 year old now even if it’s old
I get it. But give me an example
I get it. It's funny because Patriots
I get my second shot on Wednesday 
I get putting and off the tee. Is T2G everything minus putting? Is ATG just chips and green side sand? What is approach?
I get QBs want to be given all the weapons and credit, especially when they’ve been as good as Wilson. But like how many QBs in the league have top tier weapons and a great OL and all the playmaking decisions. It’s like 1-2 every year. 
I get that argument. But then like all my coworkers at the restaurant literally don’t vote. They straight up don’t care, and the polling place is literally across the street. 
I get that but actually, what does that mean?
I get that. Rooting against the circle jerk is always fun. But you usually have another team or teams that you actually support...
I get the family a military discount on the phone bill, and then I freeload
I get the fuck out of that reference 
I get the point though. They generate just as much revenue as the men, so they should be paid just as much. Makes sense. But it's not a lawsuit they're going to win; wages are based on the free market, not directly tied to revenue accrued after the contracts are signed 
I get what he's saying. I don't get how it leads to crutches being $900
I get what you're saying. I'm saying in our league, nothing should be influenced by ESPN projections, including how much is being "saved"
I get you, just wondering if there is anything proprietary about even an audio only broadcast, like how radios stations have licenses to broadcast sports 
I give up I have no idea
I give up man. This is the worst moment for America in my life since 9/11. That's not hyperbole. 
I give you all permission to root for the Warriors 
I go for it, considering its Siemian and you have 4th and inches on the 1. I'd favor that over a game winning drive 
I go inside a (just over) high school senior all the time

I got called Jonathan about 40% of the time
I got friggin roasted by the Spotify playlist judgey bot
I got got. 
I got hot takes for days boiiiiiis
I got in at mile ~1500, so nobody is going that far and not in it for the hike
I got in fake ID trouble there soph year and had to do 4 Saturday’s of community service and said I’d never go there again. But man those sandwiches are too good
I got in legal trouble at moogys so that makes me want to lower them in the power rankings but their food was friggin good
I got into a healthcare position with brooke a few weeks ago and she made it so persona hahahaha
I got invited out tn and I discovered this town doesn’t have uber
I got it
I got literally the worst possible rarity score hahaha
I got my $50 from Joe and Marcus
I got my first day off tomorrow. I worked 80 hours 2 straight weeks. Pretty sure that makes me the hardest govt worker of all time and also Chris Kyle 🇺🇸 
I got my one and only perfection on Zanzibar 
I got my order confirmed email, but not order processed or whatever
I got my second vaccine dose 22 hours ago and have no side effect symptoms other than a sore arm
I got off lucky last time with the failed drug test. Can’t catch lightning in a bottle twice I guess 
I got Placido Polanco once and felt like a genius 
I got pulled into an office for a talking to, so I might as well have said ayfkm
I got sick right after too and I thought it was gross Tyler’s strep and got tested, which cost a ton because my Obamacare was in CA only at the time 
I got some sucker to give me Biden at +150
I got surgery on my foot 2 years ago. The sock that they gave me to wear after the surgery was like $75
I got the AmEx BlueCash Everyday card as best fit but those damn Tina Fey commercials are so fucking annoying that I don't even want it
I got the joke goody. Don’t worry 
I got this one
I got through one season
I got through one sentence and expected a 4-0 ballgame, and then Frankie beat me to it
I got tired of that guys schtick and unfollowed but that tweet makes me want to follow again
I got to diamond in StarCraft 2 during lockdown COVID. That’s honestly the most recent game I was close to top tier in
I got to Platinum with Protoss in SC2. Was too young to be actually good at SC:BW, but damn I loved that game
I got to see a missile test today so that was pretty cool, I’ve never seen one in real life before. They did the whole t-minus-30 seconds and everything
I got yelled at for taking too long to call the fall in commands but other than that it went well. It’s kinda funny that you get yelled at if you breathe wrong, but if you do everything correct, dead silence. 
I gotta admit these random brackets and “you can only pick 3” things that have been all over Twitter are entertaining as hell
I gotta imagine posting political stuff (of any kind) on social media is always a net negative in terms of recipients’ aggregate net opinion of the poster
I gotta imagine Stanford is one of the most desirable matches in the world
I gotta put becker at 1 for the whole Marcus prank interview thing
I gotta respect goody for fighting any backlash to the death. Kid has never conceded an L in his life
I guarantee I have receipts in here saying I wanted cousins
I guarantee if you asked people their max bench, there would be a disproportionately high number of 225 claims and low number of 205-215 claims
I guarantee Joe is an incredible lay
I guarantee that given the choice between using steroids or knowing what pitch is coming, 100% of hitters would say the latter
I guess “don’t feel bad, dozens of other teams are getting fucked too”
I guess 4/10 if you count Corey Davis 
I guess all of those could apply to #5 as well 
I guess he is minimum eligible
I guess I agree that an established taxi service has a starting leg up, but I think anybody who wants to drive uber in a small market can do so and be equally competitive with the taxis 
I guess I don't care much for her either but she has made generational classics for years and years
I guess I miss emotional whiny post-breakup country pop taylor...
I guess I should've just said that...
I guess I thought you had a better reason
I guess I’d consider myself a domestic policy libertarian (except actual libertarians suck) and a foreign policy ultra-hawk
I guess I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't return the money, I'm calling the cops and his school. And I'm ripping him on Reddit no matter what. I think that's all I can do
I guess in a vacuum I’d prefer him to Jimmy G, but Jimmy G is on his fat contract for 2 more years and idk how much we’d have to trade to get him. Also he’s been pretty trash this year so far so need to see how rest of the season goes
I guess it helps GMs too... and therefore fan bases. But if the rule was repealed, what bad things would happen?
I guess it was just that dalbs was so worked up about it that I thought it was a bigger deal than it was
I guess it’s more that since you had Ohio blue, I’d expect you have the whole Midwest blue
I guess it's not that crazy, but it was pretty interesting to read how these guys are basically operating like a Mafia, and they all know how illegal this is. There are wiretapped conversations, hidden cameras, and everything
I guess it's sorta like the in-game purchases for video games. All the kids play, but the ones who spend the thousands on digital goodies are the adults
I guess michael Phelps comes closest
I guess modern family?
I guess now comes either repeal attempt part 4(?), a health insurance market stabilization bill, or Obamacare continues as it will, death spiral or not
I guess now I have to root for Richard Sherman
I guess our opinions of “really bad teams” is different
I guess ray just didn't really like them that much and they all thought he did lol
I guess some USC cocksuckers and delusional bears fans 
I guess sprained MCL, he'll return
I guess that’s one way to look at it. To me its more about him feeling so smug and protected in his little studio and having his reality shattered, because there is no way he would have done the same in a bar
I guess that's the core of the disagreement then. I think America's progress is awesome and we can build further upon that through unity behind the flag.
I guess the Economist is pretty good. Reason and Commentary are good too, reason being more libertarian. 
I guess the weight loss bet hasn’t started yet
I guess they’re trying to strike while the Wilson Lockett Metcalf weapons are hot, even tho they have no OL
I guess this sorta comes back to Marcus' AMA thing.  Colleges got a similar thing going on haha
I guess unless you’re a big Gonzaga basketball fan or something 
I guess we can cross that bridge when we get to it
I guessed Kerry wood first. Wrong 
I had 2 McChickens and a small fries 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
i had 3 random roommates for my last 4 months in NYC. Would not recommend.
I had 5 top 15 receivers (#tbt to 2015 Becker's Solid Receivers). Needed to get rid of one of them
I had a 4 year war with BC Dining on maximizing my steak and cheeses. First id do Large steak and cheese on a regular bun, but then they started catching on to that around mid sophomore year. Then I started asking for large steak with only 2 cheeses, so when they'd put the bread out, they'd see 2 cheeses and think it's a regular.
I had a catastrophic year
I had a cig and got my palm read by some weirdo and he told me I was gonna die in war
I had a coworker named sathiyanarayana. Once I got that one I was confident I could get them all
I had a Jason Kidd poster 
I had a McRib once. I do not have a desire to have another, but I’m glad I had it
I had a roommate who would, on literally a daily basis, drink 18 beers and leave them everywhere and pass out on the couch, often with a lip in. I would've been angry if it wasn't so fucking funny
I had a two hole stretch where I went +8
I had an advantage on this one
I had class with that girl. Think she was honors Econ
I had his MLB showdown card 
I had impossible meatballs in Cambridge. They were ok, it was mostly sauce-flavored anyway
I had Kentucky winning it all lmao
I had like 5 girlfriends in 8th grade
I had like 500 candy bars on the AT. I am very well versed in candy bars lol
"I had literally forgotten about it lol. Yeah RHA staff barely pretended that the school wouldnt rather just take $250. And I was never given a response, and I followed up (only) twice. 

Then the other thing was I tried to have that panel for A&S seniors in the most popular 5 majors to talk about their classes and paths to freshmen and sophomores, and it was all approved and everything. Then RHA realized that the panel might say that not every class/professor is equal and nixed it the week it was supposed to happen. And Coleman was a huge asshole about it too, fat piece of shit. "
I had many days where a good 65-70 hour week was actually required, but for standard work, 40 cut it easily. And I often got shit for doing 40 lol
I had nightmares last night about Eli Manning throwing 6 TDs like he did against the Saints
I had no clue. See?
I had no idea Goody was such an Urban Meyer Stan
I had no idea. Apologies if we were not supposed to talk about something fun that we all enjoy 
I had the best cranberry sauce of my life on thanksgiving, and it was better because it was mostly raspberries. Still not in the top half of the power rankings 
I had the cheez it Crunchwrap when it was a special. It was like a Crunchwrap but slightly worse
I had them a ton when I was a kid and all of a sudden didn’t see or think about one in like 10 years
I had them in the Super Bowl
I had these in like 6th grade hahaha
I had this cringingly awkward conversation when he showed up to my room for some reason like the following week, after hearing them talk all week about how weird it was, and I word vomited“oh btw you know your prof pic...” then thought fuck, idk why I said that, oh well no turning back
I had this printed and hung up at my desk in the pentagon 
I had thought there was way too much uncertainty with him changing teams to draft him in the mid 2nd. Turns out I should’ve just bet on his talent. I was obviously deadass wrong, but I don’t hate my thought process 
i had to get those losses off my chesst
I had to look at johns team to see if Goodys claims were true. The only non-QB player projected for more than 10 is Panthers D 😂😂
I had to play if off cool because of the utter stupidity, but that hurt realllllllly bad
I had to screenshot hahahaha
I had to scroll so far back
I had to take one for onboarding at my new project at AmEx, so fingers crossed they dont care about THC... but Accenture knows I tested THC positive regardless, so that will be fun
I had to watch a video of his dad on his birthday. Why?
I half agree with that. the current situation is close to best case scenario for Biden, but it was far from guaranteed 4 hours ago
I half pity, half "you deserve it" Knicks fans
I half want a sleeve tattoo. I think they look sick
I hate cognitive dissonance. I’m gonna blame Obama 
I hate crowds at debates
I hate Gavin but he’s prob the best option 
I hate having the whole season reduced to a semi farcical match given the conditions 
I hate him more
I hate Hollywood. No shame in admitting it
I hate how it affects us worse than people from Iowa 
I hate Jay Cutler
I hate Jay cutler
I hate jon jones 
I hate Jon Jones 
I hate politics
I hate portnoy tho so I don’t like to admit that
I hate Sharp Football he’s a huge hack
I hate that Mac Jones is involved in 4/5 of those bets
I hate that name. Much prefer “Ali”. In fact I’ll literally start 1400 years of war over it. 
I hate that video because one of the clowns is wearing a giants hat
I hate the fats
I hate the high fives between every fucking shot
I hate the host 
I hate the pickle
I hate the social media response to these things. I honestly wish "thoughts and prayers" was all anybody would write for the first 24 hours 
I hate the text group
I hate the underthrown ball = PI rule 
"I hate them because: 
1) They beat the Niners twice (once of which literally caused Covid and killed millions of people)
2) Mahomes has been a huge prick with the whining, the fake slides, fake out of bounds, unnecessary roughnesses
3) The team and their fans constantly talk enormous shit and play victim at the same time
4) The NFL and ref weekly onfield blowjobs have gotten tiring
5) yeah I’ll admit I’m sick of the Kelce and Swift shenanigans
6) fuck bundle rooski"
I hate this bitch
I hate this video because he’s wearing a giants beanie
I hate those calls
I hate those half second late hit penalties
I hate to admit it but I think Jeudy is also just a guy and Steve smith was right (while my best ball drafts were wrong)
I hate to admit it, but the Kelleher Plan probably couldn't help this kid
I hate to say it but I think the Eagles are gonna be really good this year
I hate to say it, but early ToTF favorite has to be the Pats 
I hate Warren Sharp but he’s right sometimes, including this time
I hate when a player gets fouled and goes down to draw the foul instead of trying to fight through it and score anyway. Like you said it’s so rare so it would only affect like 5% (pure guess) of fouls, but also lead to more awesome highlights 
I hate when there’s a decision that makes me, with zero snaps of organized football as a player, coach, or fucking towel boy, think I can do better than people who get paid millions to make these decisions
I hate your photoshops Chan
I hate Zo so much
"I hated him for the Decision and hated him throughout Miami for that, mainly because of all the ""I won't leave Cleveland without a championship"" garbage. In the wake of that, he reacted really poorly to the fans who started hating on him. When he went on the rant about how they're still poor and he's still him, that was my peak Lebron hate. 

Since he's been back to Cleveland, I don't hate him anymore. He's matured a lot and better understands all the good and bad that comes with being the generational face of the NBA. Yes he's self important, but shit man, he IS important. I truly think he's trying his hardest to be the best teammate and player he can be. If it turns out it's all a facade then fuck him, but I don't think it is. "
I hated it when it came out. I’ve enjoyed it since.
I hated the angels in 2002 and maybe the few years after but not since 
I have
I have >150 Doduo candy. How I wish it was Pidgey candy.
I have 16 Pokemon ready for evolution, can't wait :D
I have 2 lulu shorts and they’re my favorite
I have 2 QBs on my bench who are both significantly better than Alex smith...
I have 2 things to say. 1) It’s $25. A night out is $50. This lasts 16 weeks. 2) this league has been an integral part of my friendship with a lot of you, and I believe high stakes make it more competitive and exciting and fun
I have 2 years
I have 8 aunts/uncles on my dad's side, in a wide range of life success and mental health.  There seems to be an inverse correlation between life success and amount of unsolicited advice given
I have a 10 inch weiner
I have a 2-1 bet risking $50 that Trump will lose by 100 electoral votes, so that should put me back in the black after my bad Rubio misread
I have a car
I have a counterpart in London who has a preplanned vacation for all of August. Golddicks has a big deadline Sept 1. I am leading the workstream while he's out, and they had to either fly me out for the month, or have somebody come in and backfill for him. They chose the latter, even though it might take that person the whole month to get up to speed
I have a cousin who is a Harry styles stan and planned out not only her outfit, but her less passionate sisters outfit too
I have a cousin who is IB at GS. She’s one of those sickos who enjoys it. She was one of those girls who enjoyed homework growing up. I don’t fucking understand it
I have a Dell Inspiron. It's pretty great, about $700
I have a feeling Bryson is gonna be the cringey-eat trash talker ever
I have a feeling you already know the answer...
I have a fetish for instant karma
I have a flight at around noon so im probably out for anything
I have a Godwins law take on this. Anybody who uses “military industrial complex” unironically in an argument instantly loses
I have a guess: we lose money
I have a hint 
I have a huge crush on Michela’s sister tho
I have a hunch that two of the factors for dissuading participation are 1) the  complicated format, and 2) our tendency to be little bitches about everything
I have a lifting spreadsheet I use for myself. I can send to you if you want
i have a mini bar like once a week. theres always a bowl in the squadron bar
I have a new #1 most athletic achievement
I have a Roth 401k. Can I put any and all cash in there from any source?
I have a second cousin there
I have a similar strategy. I propose the first time she lets me hit it from behind and I pop the question and she turns around and says what?? And I jizz all over her face
I have a small dick this season :(
I have a solo room if someone wants to share (and split cost)
I have a theory goodwin quit the league and gifted his team to emyr all while knowing he would come back after a year, splitting up the 24B alliance and poaching the black half for himself
I have a theory that success of a countries women's sports is directly correlated to the countries rating on the human rights index
I have a Vokey SM4 lol
I have a yogurt and coffee for breakfast, $4.38
I have added crosswordle to my daily morning routine. Shoutout to @Kyrie is MY 🏀 FLB

I have always been a proponent of all trades going through. You know this
I have always been an Evan Neal Stan
I have an account under my name that gets reimbursed by the govt
I have an apology to make. The chart I shared showing overall deaths plummeting had significant missing data, and only 27 states have reported 100%. With only those 27 states, there is no differentiation from usual trends 
I have an azubuike autograph lol
I have an idea. Draft dollars are purchasable on the closed market, starting at $100 / 1 draft dollar. Profits distributed equally amongst other league members
I have an idea: a one game NFL preseason. 
I have another addition to my feats of athleticism list. When me and @It’s spring training - more important than bball were at Citi Field for the NL WC game, and Literally Conor Gillespie hit a go ahead HR in the 8th, I set world record for fastest human sprint (unconfirmed) 
I have another interior decoration question for y’all (y’all wives preferably). I have this AF patch board that I would put up at my desk but it’s open workstations so I can’t do that. Is it tacky to hang up in my apartment. If not, bedroom or living room?
I have become softbody. It feels bad. 
I have been hoodwinked
I have been instructed to clarify that I can’t just say whatever I want and attribute it to her
I have been issued deployment orders
I have been loosely following the discussion on Twitter 
i have been playing chess online, its weirdly addicting lol.  so lemme know if anybody wants to play
I have been thoroughly enjoying JT trivia 
I have been to Sedona in February. It is nice 
I have been told to expect no travel orders until June 30, so I’m almost certainly out
I have been told to expect that the base will shut down certain shops, including mine, on Monday for 2 weeks
I have been unbelievably unlucky for a year and a half now
I have been. It's the one time where I legit was stuck on the mountain because I thought my dick was bigger than it was. Had a bad time. 
I have bets with Becker and Drachman
I have bought my flight for 9/29-31 weekend

I have gray hiking socks
I have groupme open on my web browser at work
I have honestly no clue what trump policy is, and if congress passes it if/when it actually gets proposed 
I have hope that he’ll do the right thing, and this is largely a troll job
I have input all the keeper information in the google sheet
I have landed in DC
I have learned that “Fresco” is a Mexican homophobic slur
I have Lebron winning 
I have literally never given less of a fuck about anything 
I have literally never seen an ad for that show and wouldn’t know of it’s existence but for this groupme
I have literally no idea
I have literally no idea who that is
I have literally zero idea how good I am at bowling so I have no clue. But 100/1 odds is tempting…
I have made par on 13 of my last 18 holes. Back at it baby 💪🏼 🇺🇸
I have met Frankie zero times and I infinitely prefer him to the Midge 
I have military processing that day. Should be done by 3 PM PST so 6 is as early as I can do too
I have moved out of the gordo
i have muted like 100 of the big accounts on the far right and far left and my twitter experience is so much more pleasant
I have my first EP league match tomorrow. Never played actual “competitive” golf before so I’m pretty excited 
I have my trusty 538 to back me up too
I have never been able to get through this whole video. The cringe is unbearable
I have never been more ahead of the curve on anything in my life
I have never been more conflicted on anything in my life
I have never been more confused about people who prefer standard time. It’s fucking terrible when it gets dark at 5-6 pm for months    
I have never done anything illegal sexually in the US
I have never heard of Anora in my entire life
I have never heard of baked Alaska until now
I have never jerked it during class and only once at work
I have never met nan. I only know she was on joe Bourque hate list (tm) because of the Clemson trip 
I have never once remembered who broke what news
I have never played or seen pickle ball in my life and I am 100% sure this is the case
I have never rooted for any of my teams to lose 
I have never seen the show but “gay meth head tiger owner” sounds incredible
I have no choice but to stan Jonathan Taylor
i have no clue
I have no clue
I have no clue but given the context I am highly confident it’s bullshit
I have no clue though
I have no clue what his name is
I have no clue what you're talking about until Beckers photo but that's 100% it 
I have no clue what you're talking about?
I have no clue whoever was the SJW one
I have no clue. Probably very little, but housing abroad paid for and an easy as hell job. I know a girl from fairfield who does it for their Florence program. 
I have no idea but the responses like “Hermione would hate you” make me laugh
I have no idea if I paid or not and goody i also don't know what you're talking about...
"I have no idea what happens from here. This war is existential for Putin and it appears he cannot have an off ramp. But the Russian army morale is crumbling and the home front disapproval appears significant and increasing, and the Russian economy appears poised to collapse. I don’t think a coup is going to happen per se, but I think the aforementioned Russian problems in almost every aspect cannot be overstated.

And it’s all due to an unforced, unprovoked invasion. Literally a historic blunder."
I have no idea what I was talking about
I have no idea what that is
I have no idea what this bet is
I have no idea what you guys are talking about?
I have no idea what you're talking about
I have no idea where that hashtag will ever be relevant but it's hilarious for some reason
i have no idea. all i know its not mandatory and is an opt-in system at this point.
I have no idea?
I have no idea?
I have no problem with Michael Thomas and whoever was kept in the past 2 years
I have no qualms about diluting the Jesuit mission statement via de-prioritizing the humanities. I think the immersion and service trips are way more meaningful anyways. 
I have no response so I'm gonna go back to talking about Ashley
I have no upcoming schedule conflicts
I have not and will not see it but I’ve heard it’s a train wreck 
I have not been plugged in
I have not seen that 
I have not taken any grad classes. I am planning to take the GMAT to keep the options open
I have nothing against lock, seems like a cool guy. I just think he is garbage and it behooves me that Denver isn’t signing one of the far superior available black QBs
I have nothing planned that weekend, but you know what I'm gonna ask
I have noticed there are 2 very different vaccine-skeptical mindsets: 1) is “this vaccines seems super rushed, I wanna wait for others to take it first” and 2) “I know more than the scientists, this vaccine is not safe”. 
I have one 
I have only been aware of it for 10 seconds and it's my favorite book of all time
I have QBs to trade (ARog, Cursun Pulmur, Tanner Hill). Looking primarily for WRs. Admittedly going to ask for a lot for either Rodgers or Pulmur
I have read lots about it on both SB Nation and 538. Never really read the ringer but maybe I should 
I have read takes that the reason is that Intuit and similar tax filing companies lobby Congress to remain in the status quo. Idk if that’s legit or the same tired “blame big business” attack. But I can see it being true. 
I have received my gift
I have received my secret Santa
I have received snaps from them but never seen them in person.
I have refreshed IG 20 times wtf is going on
I have slept on the couch of 9/13 FH (10/14 if you include myself)
I have some cash floating and I'm tryna throw it in an index, and I want to know if buying now is still hyper risky, considering S&P is at its lowest point in 2 years 
I have some solid WRs though
I have spent all day building this dresser and nightstand and I am very proud, so I would like to share
I have still not been accepted by tankie boy and I am furious 
I have successfully gotten my team at GS to start referring to commodities as "mods". Only a matter of time before the whole firm does
I have that printed out and on my wall at my desk
I have the benefit of having Marcus getting 95% of the flak
I have the best words. I'm very highly educated. I went to an Ivy League school 
I have the money. I don't have the time.
I have to do a zoom orientation meeting thing today and big yikes on this slide
I have to get something off my chest. I have been “cheating” at wordle because I look at groupme in the morning and I know that Becker uses “adieu” as his first word. I have not been posting my results for that reason. I cannot take the shame any longer and must confess. 
I have to go but offer is on the table for $20
I have to imagine Kamala projection is the status quo because she has no real policies. Trump should be business friendly but talks about tariffs and protectionism incessantly, although the markets may not be taking him seriously 
I have to look at the next date. I didn't register for the August one because I was hoping I'd be in London but that didn't happen
I have to show at 7:30 tomorrow too. Some chicken poo
I have to wait for my boss to be away (which is a lot). But he's one of those guys where if you print something out and go pick it up, he asks where you're going 
I have trouble with double blacks. They’re usually narrow and/or tons of trees, and the snow is so deep it’s very difficult. 
I have tuned in to watch 3 times this year (an increase from zero times in the previous 31 years)
I have unframed posters in my room
I have until end of May to apply
I have until Sunday to make the decision
I have very dry hands
I have very little idea of how defensive schemes work, and how much of a good defense is player athletic talent vs reading the offense vs play calling. Like I can rarely look at a defense and call what they're going to do. 
I have YouTubeTV so I think the ads are different
I have zero animosity towards him
I have zero recollection of
I haven’t
I haven’t been able to check for more than a second
I haven’t been paid yet, so no lol
I haven’t been really interested in a show since
"I haven’t closely watched a NCAAM game all season

But when in doubt, unders. "
I haven’t cooked a meal not in an instant pot in at least 6 months
I haven’t felt as strongly anti rollback as much as I thought I would because the players don’t seem to be that pissed
I haven’t felt weak yet but if I do later then I’ll have to increase. I’m also gonna gain 5 pounds back on this Ireland trip that i leave for tomorrow 
I haven’t heard any serious takes that actually more infections are good
I haven’t heard of it until now but, in my professional legal opinion, that sounds retarded. He’s alleging the giants followed the letter but not the spirit of the Rooney rule?
I haven’t heard they’ve had any positive tests
I haven’t laughed this many times at groupme in a long time 
"I haven’t listened to the whole speech but from what I gather:

Hegseth is a buffoon. This meeting was basically a multi million dollar pep rally and culture war speech. He has no clue how to do his job so he falls back on banal things like fitness. 

That said, I actually agree with a lot of his points. The beards, appearance, and fitness standards have gotten way out of control. The systems used to prevent harassment are being abused and commanders are feeling disempowered. The mandatory trainings are a giant waste of time. "
I haven’t made a bet with Joe in 5 years 😢 
I haven’t met a single NM State fan
I haven’t officially canceled tickets yet but just letting y’all know
I haven’t read it
I haven’t received a gift but that’s prob because I’m home in San Mateo and it was sent to Alamogordo. I will be back on the 28th but don’t need to delay the gift zoom if you don’t want to
I haven’t received anything after the save the date. I intend to go though
I haven’t seen it and want to know if I should
I haven’t seen it yet, I also wanted to know the answer to this question
I haven’t seen Korea
I haven’t seen or heard Jim Rome in like 15 years
I haven’t seen that many zombie things actually. Never saw TWD, or 28 days later. Ive basically only seen WWZ and that movie was retarded
I haven’t taken a bath in years, but I have no problem peeing in the shower
I haven’t taken a science class since high school, but I’m declaring “calloused to hits” as quackery
I haven’t the slightest idea
I haven’t yet read any takes saying this punishment isn’t harsh. Other than the those who say to vacate the title 
I haven't a clue lol
I haven't a clue to be honest
I haven't a clue. I wonder how much of cryptos investors are even US based. I feel like it's utility is more valuable somewhere like Russia or another economy that's prone to inflation and/or corruption
I haven't been this ignored since I hit on that cart girl
I haven't booked flights yet. Was wondering if it was worth it to try spend the weekend. 
I haven't eaten anything in 29 hours and I've taken like 7 shits today. Where does it come from?!?! 
I haven't even SEEN ruby since college
I haven't gone on a political rant in here in a while. Thanks for providing me the avenue to
I haven't listened to an Accenture conference call in months haha
I havent made a comment on Reddit in like 10 years
I haven't seen Marcus since graduation. What gives with that??
I haven't seen rogue one and still want to
I haven't seen that commercial in like 2 years, thank god
I haven't the slightest clue 
I haven't thought about the specifics enough but I'm on the side of goody here. Let people do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. Sure as fuck am not paying tax dollars for that rehab though
I haven't used Facebook since college
I haven't watched a full non-March madness college basketball game in years 
i havent watched a single minute of BC hoops since that time I went to a game with Joe
I haven't, but I think you've mentioned it on one of our Boston-Stamford rides. Funny he says that, because the NYT article takes it as a given that the satirists and entertainment industry tends to run socially left of center, sort of naturally creating passive change. Then he says it's gone to a whole different level with stuff like Caitlyn Jenner winning the Arthur Ashe award, etc. 
I heard a bunch of people yelling in public so now I support their cause!!
I heard a great rule around tipping (Maybe bars excluded). If I order standing up, I’m not tipping shit. 
I heard a theory once that each song on dark side of the moon is a way that you can go insane
I heard a theory that for super bowl commercials, companies purposely make terrible commercials (e.g. Nationwide dead kid) just to get people talking about it, get it trending on twitter, etc. Certainly plausible
I heard a theory that Trumps 900MM loss on his casino is actually a front to launder Russian money, and that this could be proof. Other guesses are just proof of Russian funding, behind the scenes deals, etc
I heard his ribs crunch 
I heard it’s all about peptides nowadays
I heard jedeveon Clowney is celebrating Jeff’s murder because he thinks he’s overrated  
I heard Jeff starts his workouts with 30 consecutive muscle ups
I heard Marcus and Shelbie would bang on their least favorite students' desks during recess
I heard she called them mudbloods
I heard The Beatdown in Beantown is projected to outsell Mayweather-Pacquiao
I heard the best Mexican food is in Dublin
I heard the house warming party invite was sent to all wedding invitees 
I heard the SEC teams get blackout drunk before the meaningless bowl games, just to give themselves an excuse if they lose
I heard the Ukrainians are gonna have to assemble the weapons and armor themselves
I heard Trump called him but he refused just like everybody else
I heard yanny first but now I hear laurel and my mind is blown again
i heard you do need decent quads to get to the tops of some mountains
I hearted most of your posts 🇺🇸
I highly doubt that merging was Saudi’s master plan tho. I think Norman sold them into thinking LIV was gonna be huge, it was failing to profit but had a ton of headlines, then they lucked into this merger.
I highly recommend hearthstone. Free to play, can play on mobile, and its both very simple and incredibly complex
I hit 4 months tomorrow boys. 66.6 % (repeating of course) done
I hit the GPI delta threshold that was so egregious that it sapped my will to live
I hold my phone and the cord to my headphones bounces around. It's mildly annoying
I honestly actually would not
I honestly don't care as much about specifics of rules as long as strokes are counted. I'm good with gimmes and a 1 reshot off the tee per 9. 
I honestly think he’s stuck in the plot web
I honestly thought you were joking when you said you didn’t give him more shit than anyone else 
I hope batali at least had some good lines. “Hey baby you want some of my special sauce??”
I hope he finishes with 123 yards, a TD, and a fumble. 
I hope he’s hot
I hope I Am Legend doesn’t end up being a true story
I hope I’m intelligence and deploy a few times
I hope it's a brazzers gift card
I hope it's called Fiberglass-Steel
I hope MLB GMs agree with you knuckleheads
I hope nobody actually supports legalizing meth 
I hope Pablo hits .380 and turns back into the lovable Panda that he was in SF
I hope shelbie has a higher opinion of me than I think she has 
I hope the Cancun trip is effectively weaponized against him. Although he’s not up until 2024.
I hope the niners trades weren’t too clever by half
I hope the pirates super fans are called mass hole pirates
I hope the statements by the feds are accurate 
I hope there’s a mid season locker room mutiny
I hope they make The F9al Fast and Furious and Hey Baby Do You Come Here F10
I hope this butthole has a glorious public downfall
I hope this isn’t a harbinger for Hafley
I hope to finish puberty the way Gordon Hayward finished puberty 
I hope you call them that to your future patients 
I hope you have that tough decision 
I hung out with him several times in NYC. He got weirder and weirder and I haven’t spoken to him in years now
I identify pretty skrongly with the Chineseness, but the white half is just white.
I imagine "higher" meaning further away from the muscle
I imagine james tried to move in first and Angela was like no, then goodwin puts on his captain save-a-ho hat and swoops in. Is that accurate?
I immediately go to my tech school, then immediately get assigned to a squadron 
I immediately take that back due to the amount of anti semitism that would be on that pod
I implore you all to play best ball. It’s fun as hell 
I initially didn’t think I’d be down with that, but it’s possible curiosity would get the better of me
I initially didn't think this was gonna be Islam related, as those are almost always martyrdom attacks. Turns out it very closely resembles the boston marathon attacks 
I initially thought it was LL Cool J, which in a post 2005 world, Is a fucking retarded name 
I intend to go
I intend to watch my brother play guitar Friday night so TBD on BBQ
I introduced goody to james, who introduced goody to angela. Ipso factor, you’re welcome for your fiancé goodwin
I ironically have smoked with both James and nick drachman
I just assumed “disgusting abomination” was classic becker hyperbole but wow it’s not at all
I just blame Emyr whenever anything goes wrong
I just bought a pack of smokes to soothe my depression 
I just can't believe it's split so evenly, and both sides are completely flabbergasted that the other side exists
I just can't help but like that sentence no matter who said it 
I just can't imagine what the GOPe plan is to deal with this guy? Is Trump really going to be the president and make presidential decisions? Or is Ryan going to be the president de facto? And if things go poorly, trump will obviously blame everybody else, so do his supporters believe him?
I just checked their website by the look of it, it seems like you would be waist deep in corporate atmosphere
I just did my M4 qualifying for pre-deployment. We get a practice round and then the scored round. Practice round I hit 16/24, the bare minimum passing score. I’m like oh fuck I’m straight trash, I need to really focus or I’ll fail. Scoring round: I focus really hard on every shot. 22/24, USAF “M4 expert marksman” lmfao
I just don’t get it
I just don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed a meal at Cheesecake Factory  
I just don’t wanna have to buy new balls
I just don't like preachy hippo crates
I just feel like there needs to be a way to limit the vote to people who actually care about the future of the country and the world
I just felt like my resume was the most important part of my application, and internships were the only part of that that wasn't school.
I just finished a snake draft in an 8 man league. Every team is stacked
I just finished season 2 of Yellowstone. This show is pretty good. 
I just found out half my flight plays it and I knew it was popular but didn’t think I knew anyone who played it until now
I just found out I will be taking a 737 and I’ve never been happier to fly 14 hours in a commercial jet 
I just go straight through the government 
i just got an anthrax vaccine. it hurt.
I just got an LG gram and it’s great so far
I just got back yesterday btw Jeff
I just got catcalled... by a man...
I just got named the Iranian minister of culture
I just got on Medi-Cal. It’s absurd how easy it is
I just got to a hostel in southern Maine. It’s run by this dude who’s done a few naked and afraids 
I just had salmon for dinner and I ate the skin and she was like yo wtf, so I wanted to take a poll. Exactly 50/50 so far haha
I just hatched a 328 Onix from a 10k egg, about 4/5 CP bar full. Is that absurdly low or is Onix just that weak?
I just hate non-objectivity in a grading scale that projects itself as objective
I just heard “What Would I Change It To” for the first time and it’s my new favorite Avicii song @Coach Kevin Stechansky why have you not told me about this
I just hope NBC loses millions
I just know those are the two land locked countries in South America and I know John has been there
I just learn from my hero, Tom Brady
I just love Calvin in that strip
I just meant ability to consume! 24 donuts = 6000 calories, 24 bud lights = 2400 calories
I just pulled 14 and I wanna kill myself
I just put together the keeper sheet 3 months early #actualresponsibities
I JUST RAN AROUND MY HOUSE SCREAMING AND MY DOG IS FREAKED OUT
i just read a 538 article on the race. they said both of them are ideologically similar and have high fav/unfav ratings. but they've nevertheless been attacking each other relentlessly because thats what people do in politics now
I just read a WSJ piece on the Hindenburg criticism of Loop. Seems like they look for companies that promise things that are too good to be true, look for whether or not there’s any actual evidence of the promise being fulfilled, and short the ones where there is no evidence
I just read Bari Weiss' resignation letter.  Absolutely worth a read.
I just read the Gaetz Daily Beast article, and wow....
I just realized Emyr is the only person in this groupme that I've smoked with
I just realized how hysterical it is that Chris Paul and Austin Rivers are teammates on the Rockets, when just last year, Chris Paul led a secret passage sneak attack into the Clips locker room to kick Rivers ass. 
I just realized how ironic it is that we upped the defense scoring to prevent not playing a spot, but our kicker scoring is more negative than defenses ever were
I just remember being infuriated with his range
I just remember he dressed up as Harry Potter for a Halloween party like 6 days in a row
I just remember it against Barry. Every single time. 
I just remember what I was taught in 6th grade history: if you don’t vote, you’re gay
I just saw a BMW ad that played All The Small Things and I am mad
I just saw it. 10/10
I just shot a 76, EVEN on back 9 💪🏼 
I just shot my personal best 9 ever (the haters will say it’s fake)
I just think it's funny that Johnny football is such an afterthought already
I just think it's lolzy because a lot of people say the Comey letter won the election for Trump
i just think you'd get sick of it, but maybe im wrong
I just think you're very very good right now, so why not go for the gold right now instead of planning to go for the gold a few years in the future
I just thought it would be funny
I just thought of a football defining play: short hook and ladder with an OL being the ladder
I just today heard Marcus defend Elizabeth Warren so I know it's possible 
I just told your story to 2 coworkers and they laughed and said its just too relatable
I just tried bojack horseman. It was alright, I can see the appeal, but I stopped watching after like 6 episodes
I just use the BofA 123
I just voted. Never voted blue before, let alone blue straight down the ticket. But these are strange times
I just wanna play music secret Santa and nobody wanted to do one after the first
I just want to be like the guys in the rap videos who throw cash around, y'all ain't never gonna experience that joy
I just wanted to show them haha
I just wish I didn’t look at the camera at the last second
I just wish it was funnier
I keep forgetting that’s he’s an international celebrity
I keep in touch with like 5 but obviously don’t see them often 
I keep it in Accenture. Then I have my Roth 401k/IRA split into like 4 funds but trending aggressive. All the rest of my positions are just holding the S&P
I kept trying to make eye contact with joe through the window but he kept giggling and averting his eyes
I kid I kid, but technically their margins are trending in the right direction. And yeah darrow I think it was a offer from Facebook, but idk the price
I killed them. Not just the amen but the awomen and achildren too.
I kinda like the yellow. It was (sorta) iconic
I kinda see it. Maddie says not at all
I knew it was either Guyana or Suriname because in 8th grade Spanish class we had to learn the names of all the Spanish speaking countries and those 2 plus French Guyana weren't included
I knew it was gonna be insufferable with him there for a whole weekend
I knew that but didn’t make the connection. Shameful. 
I knew that country was corrupt ever since I saw their 1994 Junior Olympics hockey team was a bunch of goons
I knew this black dude who loved Korean food and culture so much he changed his name 
I knew this was coming but as someone who always picks the low hanging fruit I can’t hate
I know @Skimmer is interested
I know a guy who got a gig with the Biden campaign like last month. They sent him to Iowa. 
I know a guy who hates him because he won unanimous MVP, and it should've been Lebron. And it's unfair because Currys dad was an NBA player and Lebron is from the ghetto
I know a highly lucrative brand new job opening where physical fitness matters
I know but I hate it and plan on doing something else that makes much less
I know but I just want the opportunity to go at schefter
I know but I wouldn't easily pick the Broncos or Chiefs against them
I know but I’m sad it’s flatlining, hopefully temporarily 
I know but it’s sorta made the same as cheese and you’re contrarian and weird so you get tofu 
I know but my alternative was approach wedge which goes 135 no wind
I know but you really want me to say james harden and steph curry?
I know Cams stats have been mediocre. But his stats this year have been amazing and his skillset is undeniable 
I know darrow must’ve just changed his picture
I know exactly what you guys are talking about re: Katie's house
I know exactly who you’re talking about but I do not remember her name
I know for a fact that the US lapped the field in having the most generous relief program 
I know for a fact you’re a dragonfly Jones fan
I know he’s 31 and injury history but there’s no WR options 
I know he’s an FLB but this is exactly what they have
I know he’s been like this for like 5 years but has kyrie always been this much of a pain? Like at Duke and as a young guy?
I know I couldn’t believe I was nodding along in agreement with Bari fuckin Weiss
I know I heard Tony but that seemed kinda dumb to me
I know I know I accept full responsibility. I was too busy mentoring Ray McDonald. Didn't have enough time for both him and Aldon
I know I know that’s why I’d pick like black and yellow or something
I know I know, but for all the trillions we spend now on all these welfare programs, if we just turn that into cash and hand it out, it cuts a lot of bullshit out
I know I was expecting much more
I know I will entertain myself
I know I wish you could change your team name because it blows 
I know I won't be there but I'm always a fan of Black Rose. I'd recommend it
I know I’ve heard this story but forgot that detail
I know it has for me. Not the tubes, but significantly degraded. At a macro level
I know it has no force (no international treaties have force unless the US decides they do) but it’s a good start
I know it hasn’t worked out for the Vikings so far but if they didn’t think Darnold was the guy then I respect the moving on.
I know it was just a lack of defense comment
I know it’s (probably) purposely ironic, but man I am enjoying the appeal to music critics as a validation of one’s admittedly hipster music taste
I know it’s 4th and 14 but still
I know it’s a joke but the American government isn’t funding the PGA or USGA. The Saudi government slush fund is 100% funding LIV
I know it’s not disclosed by the NFL but what actual substances has he been repeat offending for?
I know it’s said a lot, but still it’s incredible that the Celtics traded the top pick and still got their guy plus a 2-5 this year
I know it's a links style course but that's about it
I know it's amazing 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 but now the niners are gonna suck so I'm gonna stop being a fan until they're good again
I know it's late but interested in hearing yalls opinions on this. Both personally and (inter)nationally
I know joe already posted this but omg it is galaxy brain levels of mental gymnastics to simultaneously claim 1) you will reattempt to end DACA, and 2) you take better care of DACA recipients than anyone 
I know joe, that's not my point
I know lol we all shat on the Oregon too
I know neither is not an option but neither
I know nobody cares about other leagues but Marcus is getting the biggest fantasy ass whooping ive ever seen in my entire life
I know nobody has answers to these, just cannot stop thinking about it
I know nothing about him
I know one guy who thinks numbers and statistics should NOT be a part of sports 
I know one of the people in music production (or something). He can get me SRO for like Tuesday nights or something haha. 
I know people don’t read links in this article, but this is a good rare 538 opinion piece on how we got to where we are
I know right? Right after I said that exit polls are garbage
I know right? So many layers to the mystery
I know rookies put a wrinkle in that 
I know same here!  Freshmen year we'd play CoD and I'd rage at the poor connection haha
I know somewhere online tracks the correct/incorrect metrics so you could look it up to see if it’s true
I know Sonmez taught game theory. I had him for micro theory
I know spin and rotation can affect how much wind affects the trajectory but it’s better than nothing
I know that’s why the emoji guy got smart after he put on his monocle
I know that's what you're saying. I'm saying that doesn't bother me, because it's Hollywood and they don't give two shits anyway 
I know the acronym, and I know one when I see one, but BB and Terrance Williams are both as 🐐 as it gets. And that confuses me.
I know the argument can be made that he’s the reason for Cleveland’s supporting player dearth, since he’s the one who stumped for max contract TT and JR, and also supposedly pushed Kyrie away. But still, it’s impossible to overstate how much he carried that team this past year
i know the front bottoms on 7, solid band actually worth checking out
I know the insurance runs have been clutch but they’ve been stifling nevertheless
I know the Joe Bourque Hate List better than he does
I know they have delayed blitzes, I'm just not sure I've ever seen rushers purposely hide themselves behind the line
I know they target the hormone receptors and not the hormones themselves. Honestly seems like a miracle drug and also anybody know where I can get some?
"I know this has been done before but I’m always down for a power rankings:
1) MBDTF
2) Cruel Summer
3) Graduation
4) Watch the Throne
5) Late Registration
6) College Dropout
7) 808s
8) Ye / Kids See Ghosts
9) Yeezus
10 TLOP
11) Jesus is King"
I know this isn't news, but Spurs have made the playoffs 19 years in a row. Holy cow. 
I know Trunk Club does something similar, but not sure exactly what
I know we had this discussion last year. I been using google docs and sheets for over a year but I can’t do that anymore, hence me asking. Figured I’d try again to try save $100
I know we settled on Friday at 9pm ET, which is still fine
I know we’ve been over this before many times but taking podcast recommendations. dont worry about repeating
I know we've already circle jerked this enough, but: http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/outkick-the-coverage/is-the-entire-mizzou-protest-based-on-lies-111115
I know what my response is gonna be whenever anyone is experiencing hard times
I know who they are, I don’t know what their food is like
I know words, I have the best words
I know words. I have the best words. 
I know words. I have the best words. 
I know y'all don't like basketball, but Warriors Spurs tonight is being called the best regular season NBA game of all time.
I know you are but what am I?
I know you don't care but General Tsos and Crab rangoons are completely not Chinese. Mushu pork is white person dish numero uno. Dumplings are legit haha. 
I know you have to strike (accept a HC role) while iron is hot. But in hindsight…
I know you still have feelings for me
"I know you think you're a big tough man
But you got whooped at golf by me Joe and Chan
So remember before you chirp and sing
You can't even beat me at your favorite thing!"
I know you too well
I know you’re joking but I think stud athlete players often make poor coaches because they expect everybody to be as athletic as they were. Whereas the worse athletes don’t have that assumption
I know you’re not a “questions guy” but do they have manny as a DH because he’s lower than Mookie? Or is it separate categories 
I know you're being sarcastic but for most start ups, it's all about users.  Profit doesnt enter the picture until wayyy later
I know you're kidding but check these numbers:
I know zero dance crews 
I know!! 
I know, and his dad was the manager!! I do NOT him being that good
I know, I roll off my project tomorrow and the press got word of it
I know. That’s 100% of the reason you’re a truther now 
I know. We're all saying the rules are stupid
I laughed out loud
I laughed out loud
I laughed out loud at that PFT tweet
I laughed out loud hahahaha
I learn from Laremy Tunsil
i learned early from the 80s italian mob movies
I learned that in my brief career as a waiter 
I learned that last weekend when I bought the hat
I learned the possible trans name is Genesis
I learned the word “whinge” from The Hound
I legit can’t think of anybody 
I legit don’t think I know anybody who’s opinion I respect who is an active Trump supporter. Those who would vote for him are a “but the democrats are worse” people, but can’t think of any “Trump is better than Romney” people 
I lied 400 ft, not meters
I lied, for absentee ballots in NY it's 4/12 to postmark, receive by 4/26. You're still good. 
I lied. Bayah, not Hadith 
I lied. Emyr does
I lied. I'm gonna go with the lowest sum of the *squared* margins of error of each team's score
I lied. It was 22/22 (plus aguayo)
I like /r/theredpill
I like 10 except for the pre-auction waiver keepers
I like AOC for her authenticity, she might be the only person in Washington who actually has that. But her decision to attack fact checkers for... checking facts is Trumpy and bad
I like basketball, but as a warriors fan, I only have been following basketball for 3 seasons
I like being reminded that Barry Bonds won 7 MVPs
I like best 7 seasons 
I like dragons
i like good and plenty
I like him. He should be Niners GM
I like how Becker said fuck politics and it turned into a quality political convo 
I like how he walks to the left to keep his line of sight with the ball
I like how in basketball, the designed plays actually work.  In soccer, the scores are so infrequent that the plays have like a 1% of working any given possession.
I like how it starts with something that seems to be common knowledge (steals are important), then makes a hot take on it (steals are really really underrated-ly important), then uses data to back it up. 
I like how we're tackling this from opposite angles. I'm trying to figure out how to get the non-payers to pay what they can afford. You're trying to figure out how to pay for the non-payers from the insurance perspective. I argue my way more directly confronts the problem. 
I like it for both. But if you’re the colts idk how you legit think you’re gonna win a Super Bowl with Daniel Jones
I like keepers I think it's really a good aspect. I don't want to deal with OBJ and Bell on the same team for 3 more years, who were initially kept when the rules were completely different 
I like mark Cuban but idk if he qualifies. And Mike Rowe but also a fringe celeb
I like my version better 
I like my version better 
I like Pidgeotto better
I like reading classified reports about world news and events, which I also read a ton of normal unclassified news about. 
I like Rubio because he's the most realistic, electable to the general public, and experienced with foreign policy, which is my #1 priority. Hillary is actually most experienced with foreign policy obviously, but she fucking supported the Arab Spring and armed/funded the "moderate" (are you fucking kidding me) Syrian Rebels who ousted Assad before defecting to ISIS. Back to Rubio, unfortunately his economic plan is admittedly a bit haywire, but I don't care because I only want Obamacare gone. 
I like that guy Curry and also Damian Greene and Kleo Thomas
I like that he cares 
I like that we're all in agreement in the top 2
I like the Arizona pick. Or we could do the Giants with DANIEL JONES. Falcons are too good to be the TOTF
I like the double games. Nobody likes a 10 pm game
I like the edited one
I like the humor where the characters just talk about how fat they are and wanting to have sex with lots of guys and say "MAH VAGINAAA" a lot 
I like the idea behind the question, not sure I like the question itself. The tennis balls school bus one is my favorite of them
I like the idea of doing all the food shit on one afternoon, sleeping, then doing the run 
I like the idea. But yeah funny how basketball is the the one where the lotto picks Matter the most, and therefore teams start tanking a third into the season
I like the part about the policy where you can't release a <21 to anyone who's not >21, even if the pickup party is dead sober
I like the progression there
I like the shade of pink. Maybe tone it down a bit (or a lot), but i like the overt morning-ness 
I like the signing of the name
I like the sound of that 
I like the stair master walkers who put 80% of their body weight in their arms
I like the Terrence Williams one more
I like the trade for the Colts 
I like the unis. Clean and simple, and the subpar logo is the right size
I like the values. Don't like a keeper limit 
I like the way he thinks and his willingness to break from the norm. I don’t know much about his background 
I like them both. I like normal names
I like them on guys, especially sleeves. I think they look sweet on skinny guys. Girls agree it looks sexy but I probably wouldn't want to wife up a girl with a ton of ink
I like this one:
I like to keep the people guessing
I like to picture a world in which Bill is relaying this story to his friends, saying "It was like 4 am and these losers weren't letting me leave!"
I like vice taxes, I voted for the tobacco tax in CA.
I like when it's really cold out so I can keep putting a pen in my mouth and people think I cape
I liked geopolitical trivia better than natural geographical trivia
I liked it
I liked that joke better when don was potus and you could say “the president never had a garbanzo bean on his face”
I liked that storyline actually. Dany and Tyrion though...
I liked the first song joe posted. Couldn’t do the smash mouth EDM. Nicks songs were trollish 
I liked the idiot cheater guy
I liked the political aspect of that fight. Might elevate it to the top of the undercard 
I liked the prelude to a foursome one better
I liked to chant an eagles on the warpath crescendo before I came
I listened to Alice’s Restaurant 
I listened to Dan Carlins episode Destroyer of Worlds yesterday and it felt very relevant 
I listened to the whole thing 3 times and it sucked all 3 times. So 54 listens for me
I literally cringe when the singing starts
I literally did
I literally don’t get it. The Democrats have a golden opportunity to brand themselves as the party of integrity and reason, and they just are unable/unwilling to do it.  
I literally don't know how to react right. Ow
I literally forgot about that but oh my god thanks for reminding me of the biggest bitch move of all time
I literally forgot that the Sox were 99% through completing trade for A-Rod
I literally forgot what Edmonds was called for like 15 minutes when we drove by BC
I literally have no clue lol
I literally just did haha
I literally just told you. 
I literally plan my hiking around football
I literally said radius side not ulnar side you quack
I literally think Schumer and Pelosi told him he's a great deal maker and everybody will love this deal, and he just said yes. 
I literally told you the one plot line I was excited for
I live half a mile from there if y’all wanna start at my place
I loathe Charles Barkley
I lobbied for the Jags. Don’t forget. 
I logged in using the Google link
I lol’d
I lol’d

I lol’d at anestos IG story where he said his favorite shows were like Big Bang theory and NCIS or something
I lol’d IRL
I lol'd 
I lol'd 
I look forward to a lucrative Super Bowl 
I looked it up btw I didn’t just know that lol
I lost $100. $50 on rubio to win the primary and $50 on the general. I think I got them at like +300 and +500 or something 
I lost 10 pounds in 2 days hahaha
I lost Cards titans over on a fucking missed PAT
I lost the Rubio bet hard :(((
I love "squid" it's a perfect description 
I love @#JustFacts✅ 
I love @#JustFacts✅  so much
I love “the tyranny of the poors”
I love Anthony goodwin 
I love Anthony goodwin 
I love Chan jumping to debunk this argument not by defending Tatum, but by going after Russ
I love Chris sale
I love dad Marcus 
I love having my mind changed where I actually believe it
I love how “gave $38 million to Israel” is on there
I love how basically no matter what, somebody will look like an lemon pepper fool
I love how BC football divides us. The irony is so thick and juicy. 
I love how Becker’s opinion of me is so much more bad boy than I really am
I love how everybody just skipped over farmers because oh yeah we can definitely just buy food from the poor countries 
I love how everybody's first answer is "buy some houses, support my friends and family, travel the world, etc", which only costs about $100MM
I love how he flops around on the ground as if he thinks it looks athletic 
I love how he wears that medal around everywhere 😂😂
I love how it’s 5 Uber weirdos and Bill still stands out as the weirdest
I love how John just ignores the whole finance theme
I love how Mark Coleman singlehandedly got headbutts made illegal 
I love how much becker loves this scene
I love how much this is bothering you
I love how people go bananas for a mediocre tiger approach
I love how she calls him don Don 
I love how she's actually his wife too
I love how that 5 second cart girl interaction has become a thing
I love how that has become a thing
I love how the CBA made the salary rules super complicated and it didn't work even a little bit 
I love how the conversation went from saving to dicks, then I brought it back to saving but it instantly went back to dicks
I love how the only two public figures the FH unanimously love are Kirk Cousins and Taylor Swift
I love how there an uncontested large gap between the Browns and whoever’s #2
I love how we’re choosing Bama the best CFB team of all time as the comparison for UCF
I love how y’all literally posted the data and are arguing about the interpretation, and now are just taking shots at the Bock
I love how zero people are defending Brian Kelly lmao
I love it
I love it
I love it
I love it 
I love it Becks
I love it when he runs a deep in route 
I love it when I don’t accidentally lie
I LOVE JACOB WOHL
I love Joe
I love Joe manchin. Actually not just Joe manchin, but the womenchin and childrenchin too. 
I love Jon Gruden hahahaha 
I love Kevin 
I love McCaffrey but I think he might just be too small for the NFL. He goes down so easy
I love me some FFL groupme drama tho
I love me some Jags this year but they’re like the hypiest team in the league
I love me some salty becker on a Saturday morning
I love Michael Thomas
I love New England
I love Peyton so much 
I love PFT Commenter
I love presnap motion
"I love r/freefolk. They are so committed to not letting D&D ever forget their awfulness.

But no I have not re-watched or ever even considered"
I love rambling trump hahahaha
I love scrambling Aaron Rodgers
I love Serena. Straight out of Compton with a crazy ass dad and managed to rise up to be the best ever. How do you hate that?
I love that “LIV strong” works so well because Lance Armstrong is also a giant piece of shit
I love that “most annoying team in the NFL” always actually means “third most annoying behind eagles and cowboys”
I love that All Too Well is just understood by the swifties to be the best song and also that most non-swifties have never even heard of it
I love that bet because it’s the only time when people really cheer for the national anthem
I love that emoji
I love that Marcus video so much 
I love that nerdy dude on CNN Harry Enten. He’s such a weirdo but he’s so smart 
I love that picture lol
I love that rap beef where Drake was revealed to have a secret child with a porn star and have acted in blackface is not the biggest rap beef L of his career
I love that the Shooter actor used to crush beers on the LIRR and hand out Shooter business cards to anyone who recognized him
I love that the start of fantasy football immediately cranks the groupme litness dial up 
I love that video
I love that you remember this
I love the animations lmao 
I love the brotherly shove name 
I love the CoC talk. Reminds me of when I used to play in 2015-16. Please continue. 
I LOVE the crypto collapse. The crypto bros were among the most insufferable people on the planet 
I love the dichotomy that the government are illuminati masterminds secretly watching and controlling our lives, and that they're too stupid to run the TSA or DMV or IRS efficiently
I love the Goodwin argument strategy
I love the guarantee that any FH social media post will get absolutely flambéed in here
I love the humble brags
I love the joe Bourque gifs
I love the NFL
I love the NFL
I love the offensive play calling always 
I love the Shinzo Abe pic but I’m pretty tempted to make this my new avi
I love the Thompson’s fondness of random athletes of the yesteryear
I love the trope of shitting on all each others industries
I love the word “jamoke”
I love the wording of the options
I love the WR sequence of catch in stride, stop on a time, defender flies past, begin YAC
I love these old school Seahawks jersrys
I love these things lmao
I love this #ASMB position tho. Never stop being you
I love those types of puzzles haha
I love tin foil hat backer 
i love to hate Elon, aka Gulag Inmate #1
I love to hate on marika
I love watching Aaron Rodgers  sacked
I love watching joe burrow, but I like watching joe emerge too
I love Wendy’s 
I love when already dislikable figures go on PR campaigns and it completely backfires
I love when Joe hates people 
I love when people own themselves
I love when y’all tell old stories that I’ve never heard before 
I love when you cross a random baseball stat that inadvertently shows how otherworldly Barry Bonds was
I love X and O football so I love it
I love Xavier Legette
I love you all, but I like my PTO too
I love you guys
I loved BC life because of the students and the campus. However I didn't like how administration dealt with housing, discipline, programming, and funding.
I loved Black Rose
I loved destiny but stopped playing a while ago since I didn't buy the newest expansion
I loved it at first but sometimes I think the icons make the screen too busy
I loved that argument last night so much 
I loved the Marcus rat jokes
I lowkey think it’s aged pretty well
I made 67 bets on individual games this season with @Jamie Bourque. I came out net fucking even. Hilarious. 
I made it 95% of the way through, then as we were RTB flying straight and not maneuvering at all, I got the sudden urge to puke. So close...
I made this reference last week and nobody got it
"I made two mistakes:
1) Getting my hopes up (in general)
2) Believing that Americans wouldn't be idiots"
I make it to like 1:20 and it feels like 10 minutes and I just can’t bear it anymore
I may have KOC too high because of this season. Maybe I should take McVay and Payton over him
I may have logged more hours onto MW2 but remember COD 4 more fondly
I may have others participating
I may have skimmed but how about BC legend Anthony Brown coming in and heroing the PAC12 championship 
I mean at this point he’s in easily cut draft territory, which means any team might be interested to see him compete for backup QB. And if his/Dads attitude and drama sucks he’s an easy cut
I mean Blame Game is great and all but not the best workout song
I mean by that it’s the mannings and it’s not close
I mean Don is the president 
I mean don't get me wrong, girl is cute and seems really sweet. Also heard she is a super high maintenance, needy girlfriend haha
I mean everybody knows you “shouldn’t” but I wouldn’t be mad. I still believe personal choices are the key. 
I mean fucking look at Saudi. They have truly insane guardianship laws
I mean Green Bay is Milwaukee tho. That’s like saying foxboro for the pats  
I mean he definitely will. But the punishment shouldn’t matter right?
I mean he did wish one was dead like last week 
I mean he outwrestled a bear when he was like 6...
I mean he was awful to start but like you said it’s a toss up so any crazy second half run could win
I mean he would have been a great FLB
I mean he’d probably just slice it even further into the woods
I mean he’s a beast but Idk how you pick him over the other 2
I mean he’s a NT it’s kind of that position by definition 
I mean how could I say no
I mean I could, but I'm not really invested in either the Falcons or the Saints
I mean I do get it. It’s money and contracts. But it fucking sucks. 
I mean I don't really know shit. But in my super unprofessional opinion I feel like trying to take time and create confusion might work better
I mean I get how estimations work but a 1% difference of a $2 billion franchise is not small potatoes
I mean I gotta commend you. Of all the haters in the FH, already disproportionately full of haters, you truly are the nastiest hater
I mean I know imma get got, but imma get mine more than I get got doh
I mean I shower everyday so that gets the job done
I mean I suppose we should be thankful that it was only the Marlins 
I mean I would certainly throw my dick in her if she let me... 
I mean I’m literally 0% down for that, but if I live forever Its possible I might get bored after like 5000 years.
I mean I’ve thought that a lot, but still it’s pretty frickin absurd
I mean if it was casual then sure, but you can't be both super serious about your game and also take 3 second balls and gimme chip ins lmao
I mean if you’re mad that the defense industry is a thing then idk what to tell you
I mean I'm never not thinking about dicks, and i have been thinking about Russia a lot recently... so YES!
I mean it can be whatever you want but yeah ideally it’s 10 rockin songs that your recipient would add to their playlist
I mean it doesn’t excuse his inaction, but I can see him not wanting to get fired, so he chooses to say he disagrees while not shutting down what has already existed before he became manager 
I mean it doesn’t matter. Just that the stros are getting pissy that people are mad at them for cheating. And it’s like 3 days into spring training 
I mean it makes sense economically, it just sucks hard for grad students who are already poor. I don't know what the estimated tax revenue increase they're projecting from this clause
I mean it was still super exciting, so overall great format change. but I’m surprised how quickly players defaulted back to the foul-drawing as soon as they started caring. I was hoping it would be more like intense pickup 
I mean it will have an temporary unofficial asterisk but this was a truly unprecedented and unavoidable situation, and nobody will care in 10 years
I mean it’s called “crazy stupid love” 
I mean it’s not Liz M or Liz F
I mean it’s pretty hypocritical to build your entire persona around eating the rich, then it’s revealed that you’re the very 1% you’ve flamed for years 
I mean it’s true
I mean it's basically golf except instead of hitting the ball into the hole you flick the ball at a Pokemon 
I mean it's the same thing we were talking about with the AFC Power Rankings. There are no powerhouse offenses in the AFC. It's the Pats, Raiders, and Steelers. 
I mean Jeff that's pretty much spot on, minus the mulatto-ness
I mean just put KD, call Lebron a C and we're good. Can't have no sub 50% FT jokers on the all NBA first team
I mean maybe I skimmed but I’ve never seen the Israelis do any of those things
I mean maybe la rouge pays him for the promotion but I wouldn't be surprised if he just got free entry and drinks or something.  It doesn't appear that he has other employment 
I mean me too but he proved his point that “I could fuck you up and you would cry like a little girl”
I mean no shit but was he a good coach before that?
I mean once you have buy in from both Tech and Biz, and of course you need to lock down your controls
I mean outside of the whole domestic violence thing, yeah chapman might be the most talented reliever in baseball
I mean revere isn’t technically Beantown but it’ll do I suppose
I mean Russ’s long history of public psychopathy don’t help him either
I mean shit, the entire country of Monaco was created by rich Europeans for the sole purpose of tax dodging.
I mean since it was a scam, they prob had an agreement to split it, and then got pissed over the split portions
I mean Since trump won in 2016, the GOP has gone full trump
I mean sitting in my apartment and drafting. Wasn't intended to be a slight at Jeff. Sorry Jeff. 
I mean sure if the player agrees
I mean that CBS news segment was a pretty good summary
I mean that picture is a little weird and try hardy
i mean that would be basically ideal right now lmao
I mean that’s kinda no shit but that’s literally why you play the games 
I mean that’s not mutually exclusive
I mean that’s what women do
I mean that's been the story of the nomination race since Day 1
I mean that's prob closest to the status quo anyway lol
I mean the fact that Anthony Davis retired year just so he could come back with another team next year really says it all
I mean the whole aroldis chapman deal this year really says it all. Taking the moral high ground is never worth it
I mean the whole funding of LIV in the first place was all sportwashing. The Saudis have no interest in golf as a sport
I mean they don't play, and they don't coach, all they do is watch and take notes... They just happen to be very dedicated and good at it
I mean they get Dangelo Russell...
I mean they grabbed a figure skater who’d never touched a hockey stick in his life so maybe aberman was top 15
I mean they’re rats. I’m imagining the scenario does not involve a lion battalion commander mission planning the rats flank from the left and calling in eagle air support 
I mean they're trying to be a top 25 school, a sports powerhouse, a Jesuit community focusing on social justice, etc. And all of those things are supposedly the #1 priority, yet I feel like they're doing none of them well. Not saying it's easy at all, but they don't seem to be making big improvements in any of those fields
I mean Trent Dilfer is honestly pretty good himself
I mean we had bigger holes on Defense but I guess they didn’t see any can’t miss defensive players and also didn’t think trading down was worth it
I mean we love the hits, but gotta come out with a new album eventually right?
I mean who among us hasn’t lost all my apes sometime or another
I mean with mortgages there is the collateral of the house
I mean with RG3 and Kap, the haters were right...
I mean yeah LFG I’m in
I mean yeah look at the chart I just posted
I mean yes but I’d prefer the number of murders on the block per year to not exceed the first digit of my rent
I mean, checkmate…
I mean, going off history, that is exactly the way to win championships. Just only 1 team historically (and 1 more in the past 5 years) have consistently done that. 
I mean, I was pretty close 
I mean, I've enjoyed every dick I've ever touched, so statistically...
I mean, we’re they right?
I meant awesome things that team #JustFalse hates for no reason
I meant DC
I meant Faiz lol
I meant golf
I meant her name lol. And where did she go to HS?
I meant hiring John Lynch as GM lol, but that too
I meant I'm going for next season only and not beyond that
I meant sancho hansinho
I meant to reply to “wordle is dumb”
I meant, I wonder if some colleges will trend toward open, some toward positive. I 100% agree with you though
I meant, if they're picked at random, can the same guy be picked twice before somebody else is picked once?
I messed up the baseball one. It's $1300-$2700 per month, then $40K if you make the 40 man roster. If you make the 40 man roster again next year, it's $80K
I microwave it. Melty cheese is worth the soggy bread. 
I might be addicted
I might be getting desensitized because I nearly gagged at the Corey hill break and this one didn’t faze me at all
I might be Varys?
I might have Alzheimer’s 
I might have to enroll just for that
I might like this Joe Mug photo more than the Joe Prep Sweater photo
I might try do a multi week trip like that around November or December
I miss anesto :(
I miss tankie doc
I miss the “I’ll fight anyone anywhere” mcgregor
I miss the good old days when it was all envelopes of cash under the table 
I miss the tankie IGs 😢 
I miss you John. Hope you’re doing well
I missed it. Thanks for pointing it out, well done
I missed that but the enema line was gold
I missed you so much
I misunderstood. Ignore me
I misunderstood. So the theory is BB purposely texted Flores to give him evidence to sue? 🤔 
I more agree with John, unfortunately. And I believe people are dumb, but I even more believe that people are myopic 
I motion to fire whoever is commissioner and nominate Joe Bourque  
I move to DC in December most likely. I will be there September 16 for a few days though 
I moved my rook from B1 to B7 as a distraction
I much prefer it to the narrated-over cliche-filled commercials that seem to be the standard
I must admit, I've enjoyed watching his demise
I must confess this is a lie. I have cooked eggs on a stovetop
I must’ve completely missed that jrue holiday is that good
i mustve scrubbed it from my brain, and thats a lot coming from me
I need a Kanye x FH song match up
I need a refresher on how the Goodwin 2 QB System (tm) works
I need a Russ cringiest moments barstool bracket
I need a TSwift album Power Rankings 
I need a WSJ subscription. And a Wash Post one as well
I need an example of said girl. Just one. 
I need proof
I need someone to go back and post all the things the FH have said about Cam over the years
I need the Browns to find a way to lose this. It would be the most browns moment in browns history. 
I need to be reminded of the specifics of those trades
I need to confess I actually chose to go to the gordo purely to get as close to Coach Spaz as I could
I need to fight someone
I need to know @The Big Dick Bandit opinion on this 
I need to know. Am I packing my bat or not?
I need to lose 10 pounds. Maybe I should sign up for one
I needed to do it twice lol
I nest everywhere but home
I never did and still don’t understand that “meme” 
I never did, but I won’t in the future too. 
I never have. I wonder if the next generation is gonna be full of them
I never heard it. I mean were all from the west coast so it didn’t really seem necessary 
I never heard of them outside that movie
I never heard this story!! 
I never know what the rule is here
I never know whose side to be on in these things 
I never meant to give off that impression and I don't think anybody else did either
I never put that together that you basically need to have 2 perfect seasons to make the CFP as a G5 team
I never realized your number was tight in the first place 
I never really looked at that chart closely but wow what a lunatic
I never removed anybody. I also never planned on DDing. That is garbage and it is rubbish and it is not true
I never thought about it until now, but if/when any of the Astros are eligible for the Hall, it is gonna be a hysterical shit show
I never thought Kars for Kids could be topped but we might be getting closer 
I never watched the mandalorian. Maybe I’ll give that a shot
I nominate Chan as a replacement if the SAT is untaken by draft
I nominate Joe Bourque
I nominate the bears as the darkest horse, hypeless team that’s gonna do solid
I nominate the Chargers 
I nominate the Lions as our TotFH
I nominate the Niners
I notice you put the number 2 in there...
I now can play wonderwall
I now expect a power rankings 
I now feel bad for the gif echoing “this is literally what you signed up for”
I now know how you conserve toilet paper, and I feel so bad for Kristen 
I obviously see where you’re coming from. But its just that he’s given everything to the Colts for 6 years, he’s mentally broken (largely due to the Colts mismanagement), and it’s tough to say “give us another year or you’re being selfish”
I occasionally identify with this particular player
I officially ship Jan 7. I’m staying in Boston until Christmas 
I often have wet dreams of watching Sale and Bumgarner chop down trees together
I often just walk up to the air crew and ask if they are gonna bust crew rest
I once again miss the Goodwin family Kwanzaa
I once called into KNBR 680 The Sports Leader to defend Brandon Belt
I once made a machine that can launch a tennis ball ~70 mph
I only ask because he just pled guilty to desertion and am wondering how his story on the podcast will line up against his story under oath
I only care about LAB RON
I only expect to be up in Boston for the T+B wedding and it’s unlikely I’ll be spending a full day on the Fuckhole open 
I only got to bang one of the customers
I only have C'Thun and Yogg-Saron so can't do all 4 sorry bruh. Also that would be a terrible deck. Thinking about tryna craft N'Zoth and build a death rattle paladin deck tho 
I only have the best interests of the big dick bandit in mind
I only know sang moon bae haha
I only know Sasha Grey lol
I only know that his big board is about as accurate than a monkey throwing darts at a wall. And he said trubisky is going first. So we'll see if he's right here or full of shit as usual
I only know the Angels used to be the California Angels because of angels in the outfield
I only picked merryweather because I played against him growing up
I only posted that pic because John said pine tar and I remember manny was one of those pine tar helmet weirdos
I only read Dune the original. Yeah it was good but I wouldn’t say life changing, especially since all the original concepts are are commonplace space scifi tropes nowadays.
I only read goodys long message where he blames Jeff for turning this into a scrap league 
I only saw Shape of Water and Darkest Hour. Shape of Water was terrible. Darkest Hour was really slow.
I only was talking about the “The Jews will extort america” part is an interesting defense
I operationally configured initial Margin exchange readiness by the deadline of today, enabling the continuation of OTC derivatives trading for Goldman Sachs, bastions of selflessness in this dark world of greed
I overlooked the pack D's weakness going into this game
I owe this friend like $600 in bets and I have to pay him so he’s not waiting for like 4 years
I own so much space in goodys head hehehe
I own zero quarter zips 
I participated until I turned 18
I passed by him and was like “holy shit that’s Minotauro” and worked up the courage to ask for a photo. Then everybody around was looking like “who bitch this is ?”
I paused
I pay $43 for internet and $65 for YouTube TV (which was $50 until last month, buttholes)
I penciled that in because of metro access to the pentagon. I’ve heard that parking is a nightmare
I personally blame Bernie Sanders 
I personally like the current date. Already got work off for this Saturday 
I pick ARI btw
I pick Buffalo for survivor pool
I pick the Patriots
I picked wolves because theyre pack animals and theyre used to working together. Pretty sure eagles are solitary animals so getting a coordinated dive bomb of eagles is not gonna happen
I plan on attending both of yours
I plan on finishing around end of September, then moving into @Liver, Laugher, Lover apartment on Oct 15
I play hearthstone a lot. Pretty good at it actually
I play in a fast pitch softball league now. Strikeouts are rare, but they definitely happen
I play Kevin back to back weeks 8 and 9. Can we change this?
I play mostly $3 regular leagues and $10 GPP leagues 
I played 5 games Saturday and hit warning track fly outs (strong wind blowing in obviously) 3 times, and i have had nightmares for 3 days 
I played a lot of Destiny in like 2015
I played a remastered Ratchet and Clank on PS4 during early lockdown COVID 
I played for a bit. Never got really into it
I played golf yesterday suckers
I played pickup a few weeks ago and omg I was absolute trash. It was embarrassing
I played Starcraft pretty well back in 2010-11, but wasnt good enough at clicking to be real good. I'm pretty filthy at Hearthstone now though...
I played TP and enjoyed it
I played Witcher 3 and it was good but I didn’t get super deep into the lore
I predict the NCAA for football is gonna collapse by end of decade. It brings nothing to the table and the momentum is against it. The teams/conferences will demand more and more and the NCAA (Neville Chamberlain Athletic Association) will appease them until they’re usefulness is done, then they will just secede altogether 
I prefer #groupmecrossover🔀
I prefer foreign policy. Domestic policy is a fucking mess
I prefer it that way. They were gonna make it to the AFC championship regardless, so this cakewalk gives us an excuse
I prefer Lena Dunham mid-shit selfies 
I prefer no nudity in tv shows 
I prefer wench
I prefer: the 2010, 2012, and 2014 World Series champions, the 2015 NBA champions and 2017 NBA favorites, and the Niners 
I preferred it when he was shilling for Russia but I’ll take this too
I probably should
I put a sprinkle on Stroud at +400 on FriendZone (ad) 
I put Marcus in the top 3
I put neither agree nor disagree for that and left wing people and church influence 
I put so many hours into this game 
I put the link in the "League Chat"
I put VCU in the elite 8…
I put victims in quotes because I don’t count a group who regularly launches unguided rockets into civilian neighborhoods as the misunderstood victim
I raged at MW2 noob tubes so much it probably took years off my life
I ran 5 on Sunday and it didn't go great lol. Might've started too fast tho 
I ran a timed 5k on Friday in the Alabama summer. Holy cow this shit is brutal. 
I ran through the National mall today and there was a big Palestine rally. Some pretty not nice signs being displayed.
I reacted way too early to the early results. But the narrative that the Dems underperformed hard in the South and SE (including Florida) is totally true. They’re gonna need to change their strategy there or keep losing, and waiting for demographic change is not a strategy
I read 1984 recently. It took like 5 days
I read 3 wipes from 2 squares. Something is nasty for that to happen
I read a compelling hypothesis that (in addition to social media), a big factor is the lack of unsupervised time for modern kids. It’s where kids learn how to deal with bullying, getting into trouble and dealing with consequences, problem solving things like how to get somewhere or get home, etc. Nowadays that doesn’t exist and kids are missing out on emotional growth 
I read a headline about U of Cambridge in the UK. The black student leaders are calling for the cancelling of a traditional ball called the Orient Express Ball because the Asian students aren't offended enough
I read a rumor that Luck hurt his shoulder snowboarding this offseason and that's why he had such a setback 
i read a smart take that theorizes Biden wanted Klob, but then that ship sailed and he's kinda waffled since. i think i agree with that
I read a take that the eagles offense has been bad because hurts has been auto rolling right after his first read, taking away the left half of the field, making the AJB/Devonta combo less effective
I read about the Italian referendum a bit but other than that pretty clueless
I read an article saying that everybody is gonna seem overpaid, and their contracts should be evaluated in a % of cap space manner, not dollars
I read Hayley Williams was gonna release an album this spring, so hopefully the rona doesn’t delay that too long 
I read he asked for Von Miller money
I read he hurt his back when Mack Daddy Santa's bag of toys was too heavy 
I read he was crushing the warm up pitches, then saw some simulated live ball and was mixed. Late on low 90s fastballs but some solid contact, fooled bad on anything off speed
I read McVay has a time management specialist on his staff 
I read similar-ish. Basically these classes weren't exclusively for the athletes, but it's obvious that they were used to raise the GPA of those who needed it, particularly the athletes. And the whole department knew about it, and the whole athletics program knew about it, And nobody said anything.
I read that 20 million people expected to be vaccinated by end of year. Which is the majority of healthcare workers and nursing home residents. I think 24 million total in those groups.
I read that too. They were looking for $6B, projected that they'll take $4B. For reference, the current owners bought the UFC in 2001 for $2M 
I read the new owners bet the house on Ronda and has been trying to recover as fast as possible without considering future ramifications
I read the same, mainly because of chemistry and crowders physical defense inside. If it ain't broke don't fix it. 
I read the same. Fuck both of these teams
i read they doubled Tyreek every single play
I read this report like ~6 months ago when it came out
I realize I’m lemon peppering here but still 
I realize my tag is covered by the bottom button but idk what it says
I realize that's an impossible question to answer, but I'm looking for vague ideas because I have none
I really can’t overstate how much of a watershed moment this is in the international security order. Maybe it’s too much to call it Berlin Wall equivalent of monumental but I don’t think it’s too far off
I really can’t stress enough that the NBAs knee bending to China is one of the most hypocritical things I’ve ever seen in my life. That includes lebron, steve Kerr, and pop 
I really don’t think ball spots matter much except on first downs though
I really don't know shit about soccer though so kinda talking out of my ass here
I really dunno why they kept him
I really enjoy these election post mortem articles 538 does.  They released the first of many today
I really hope they used the phrase pussy whipped
I really hope this isn’t because I’m in a country that unabashedly hates Jews
I really liked the Luke/Rey/Kyle storyline. I didn’t care for the Finn storyline, and fucking hated the whole Leia storyline
I really really hope that it's just our youth and inexperience that is making things seem worse than they historically are.
I really really hope that Trump's "TEST LESS" message isn't going to significantly harm something as potentially groundbreaking as this
I really think that's the perfect punishment haha. It's just 4 hours of misery, and it's hilarious
I really thought they were gonna snap it
I really wonder if Trump is going to try "drain the swamp" as he pledged, or if he'll actually defer to Paul Ryan and Co on everything... the latter seems as likely as the former to me. 
I recall @Fantasy Baseball Champion, Esq. saying he standard time because the darkness makes people more productive 
I recall a CMike Hype Train from 2015 too
I recall hearing you say that the troops are all poors, and you don’t associate with the poors
I recall like 10x more mocking of the narrative than the narrative itself 
I recently read “Dignity” by Chris Arnade. It is basically a bunch of interviews with people in “back row” America. It’s very short and gives a lot of good perspective.
I recommend Kashi bars
I refuse 
I refuse believe that’s true
I refuse to
I refuse to believe this is real 
I refuse to believe you are this obtuse
I refuse to give him any kudos
I refuse to play Vice golf balls since his cowardice
I refuse to take culinary shade from a man who lived off plain lentils and vodka waters for a full year 
I regret it unfortunately 
I regret supporting that charlatan 
I regret that it took me this long to realize Chan was making a KKK joke
I regret to inform that my succession train onboarding is off to a late start. I work a LOT more than I expected 
I regularly drink 12 beers in a Saturday lol. I have had zero doughnuts in the past year.
I reject the premise that his un-retirement caused his divorce. I think it’s more likely that things were on the rocks far beforehand (probably irrespective of football) and staying retired wouldn’t have affected it at all. 
I reluctantly admit these are valid points
I remain a staunch Herbert defender 
I remember a few years ago @Emyr Remy told me that if the Pats don't make it to the AFC championship, it's a wasted season. I rolled my eyes then, and I still do, but I can see it more now
I remember a flat wooden figure 8 shaped popsicle stick
I remember a suggestion to put solar panels on the roofs of bunch of buildings in Florence, and the city nixed it immediately because it's historic and beautiful. Interesting conflict certainly.
I remember after the cart girl incident you asked “so like does that usually work for you?” as if it’s possible have a solid history of slaying cart girls
I remember Alec took a photo before he knew anything was wrong about it, one of the Gronk bros comes up and grabs him like "delete that right now". Alec's just like "okay big dude please put me down now"
I remember all the folk getting all outraged at BCPD for not doing something about it or even acknowledging it, then it turns out to be a giant hoax hahaha
I remember because I was on the train from NYC to my aunts in NJ, just flaunting my #TeamBecker colors. And you were being a bitch with your solid WRs and I hopped off and joined #TBoJ
I remember being mediocre at Terran with marines + siege tanks, but still nowhere near good
I remember freshman year he would always show up to classes late and make a big spectacle out of himself. Then soph year I met him and thought he sucked, but not in the way I expected
I remember he wrote his Senior 5 on that fb page and commented which one was him, and ZERO people fb liked it
I remember her. She was nice
I remember in like 2014 Skip Bayless tweeted that Broncos being a +4 underdog was a direct shot at Peyton by oddsmakers. Possibly his dumbest tweet of all time
"I remember in microecon we learned about marginal value of the dollar, and how in theory the richer you are, the lower the marginal value. The theory makes sense but I didn’t (and still don’t) believe it in practice, or at least not nearly to the level it was taught. 

I see this photo and my skepticism feels justified."
I remember interviewing for ICAP. They did some questions like "who are our competitors" "what is 1/6?" etc
I remember it peaked right around Thanksgiving, right when your solid WRs turned to not so solid WRs
I remember James Gallo’s mid COVID “close friends and family only” wedding on zoom. Between Italian catholic and green orthodox, there must’ve been at least 150 people there 
I remember Landon collins calling him a cancer back when he was a rookie on the giants 
I remember lol. Do you remember how you compare to Jeff right now?
I remember Ms Trelawny(?) predicting his birthday in dead of winter, and he replies July
I remember now. Man that girl is either nucking futs, had a huge crush on you, or both
I remember one of the big Jason garret criticisms was that he never used any 
I remember one time back in like 2012/2013 the books literally closed bets on Tiger going into Sunday because he was ahead by so much
I remember one time in this groupme we were all asking you Kevin about your thoughts on marika since you spend the most time with her
I remember reading a Reddit comment on how that album basically pioneered enjambment in rap (as opposed to every line being its own sentence). And like I never wouldve known that unless it was pointed out to me
I remember reading once that, regarding multivitamins, yes it is absolutely possible that they can help certain people get the nutrients they need. However, the people who take multivitamins are the most likely people who already get enough nutrients from their normal diets. 
I remember reading that and thinking this guy had to be the biggest buzzkill in the history of college
I remember repeatedly saying “but like, we all agree it just straight up didn’t happen right”
I remember saying “you can’t have your first time touching the ball be your first PK”
I remember seeing a similar image with a stack of weights on a pull-down machine, an otherwise normal distribution but with less wear at 90 lbs and more at 100 lbs than expected.
I remember seeing an article on that Jamie. Basically refs didn't much care about the exact spot until they got to the 30ish yard line, then they increasingly care more and more
I remember seeing an interview where BB talked about nickel becoming the standard D personnel, or that pass-defending smaller LBs could rise to defend pass catching RBs; and how TEs and big slot guys could have advantages there
I remember seeing some clip on Reddit of a Dr Oz / Maury type show where this obese lady was saying it's impossible for some people to lose weight. Then there was this doctor who said that's a lie, anyone can lose weight by eating less and exercise more. Obese woman goes on a long rant about how hard it is, and the doctor says "I know it's hard, but the question was, is it impossible to lose weight, and the answer is no"
I remember seeing some stat about the hypothetical ~40th best tennis player in the world making like $75k through playing alone which is all spent on his playing expenses
I remember talking about bitcoin senior year when it skyrocketed first semester. It's now like 5x it's value then
I remember that because pomps had one of the worst fantasy drafts I’ve ever seen and had to start joique bell. I faced him week 1
I remember that one better. Connor would sing that on the AT lmao
I remember that that was awesome
I remember the Broncos-Jags game 2013 when Denver was favored by 28 or something like that hahaha
I remember the first couple times playing golf with Joe and had heard from Becker about how god awful he was, and I was like wtf where did this come from
I remember the movie but literally nothing about it. Like I forgot the main characters name was Stan Ross
I remember the opening scene where you're on the plane and then get the steak that turns into a TV 😂
I remember the trick plays where your WR would teleport downfield 
I remember thinking that girl was pretty hot
I remember thinking you were a Bock med school friend or some thing
I remember trying to play the cars game by the rules and getting frustrated that I couldn't just put down a Charizard on turn 1
I remember watching Braves games and the broadcast would zoom out, and there would be a straight line across from LF to RF. Jones was literally in line with the corners 
I remember Wes. Not Evan or Coral
I remember when Boise State was almost that team but then Colin Kaepernick and Nevada defeated them in the last second of their season
i remember when Friday came out freshman year lmao
I remember when GOT was in its heyday and people were willing to pay for just the show and HBO refused. I wonder if that ended up being a net win or loss 
I remember when he lambasted the Niners for not cutting Ray McDonald after DV, then signs Aldon Smith hahaha
I remember when he started dating some girl that year, and I have never seen somebody more purely happy with life. He was just in a great mood every day hahaha
I remember you posted it. I was wondering if I have to scroll back or can just go on the website
I removed and redownloaded the app and it largely fixed it
I repeatedly say I’m deploying in July so trying to set expectations 
I requested off Saturday but won’t know until around noon tomorrow. Highly likely I can get one of the days off but not sure which yet. So if we could hold off on booking please
I rescind. Sorry 
I rescinded a lot of Joe buck hate after his greatest call of his career
I respect that. Nobody wants to see tiger win on a missed gimme, including tiger 
I respect the balls but wow. Matt is on should’ve gone outside the fullback, wide open gap
I respect the commitment 
I respect the confidence in ball knowing to know anything about WKU or Delaware
I respect the hustle becker 
I respect the sentiment, but making major political decisions based on “this is how I feel” is a bad way to go. Especially when history would suggest the opposite
I respect the significant effort to prove Marcus right/wrong 
I respect the W/L tracking
I responded to your invite, nobody responded to mine!!
I retract
I revoke this accusation 
I rewear shit until I can't stand the smell. Usually that's 3 times for shirts and like 2 weeks for shorts
I risked $1120 with Jamie this year lol
I ruefully admit I got McCocked when Big Ben got hurt, he tweeted Steelers we’re signing Kaepernick 
I run my unit and she is useless. Everybody knows it, including the squadron commander and her. She feels like I’m undermining her authority. 
I said "it is Wednesday my dudes at work this morning and nobody got it :("
i said "lot of sandshrews" first
I said 100 at first because I thought 10000 doors
I said above: week 17 fantasy contest, pick a QB RB WR TE DST, submit the lineup head to head
I said finna 24/7 from like 2014 to 2017
I said he’s worse than Trubisky. You said he’s not. 
I said it was somewhat important 
I said mikayla not Running Stream
I said nothing!!
I said on twitter. Her response needs to be "what is this shit? Are you fucking kidding me?"
I said presnap motion a few days ago. I’d also say downfield laterals, like the Kelce to Kadarius one that got called back
I said the Jags but y’all shut that down, then I acquiesced to the lions 
I said the same thing becker
I said yeahhhhh rightttt in a PM to chan when he posted a IG story about his drive. That data doesn’t lie tho. 
I saw 3000 and thought that meant hits
I saw a dragonfly Jones tweet once that said wayne is the only rapper to have top respect from the rap heads, the thugs, and the white kids 
I saw a few episodes of fresh off the boat and I largely liked it
I saw a GS forecast that estimated 30% by March, 70% by July/august 
I saw a reel where somebody said the next time the economy is in a recession, just have Taylor go on tour 
I saw a special on ESPN about how his dad would make “tiger par” for holes when he was a kid in order to get him mentally comfortable with shooting under par. Honestly genius because it is such a mental struggle even putting for birdie. 
"I saw an IG video that said the Jets drafting Darnold over Josh Allen in 2018 is the most consequential pick in modern NFL history. 

Theory: Jets draft Allen instead, he inevitably fails because he’s on the Jets. Therefore, the NFL doesn’t fall in love with athletic project QB. Danny Dimes, Fields, Lance, AR15, McCarthy, etc aren’t drafted in early 1st."
I saw him get outed by Mia Khalifa hahaha
I saw him getting wide open repeatedly
I saw it on a plane. It was a perfect plane movie
I saw NJ political commercials nonstop. Prob same deal
i saw on FB because i posted my F-16 photo and wanted to see the hearts (which NONE of you have hearted yet)
I saw on reddit some big blockchain conference stopped accepting payments in crypto because of the high conversion fees 😂
I saw on Twitter this morning lol. But yeah nothing before that
I saw one for US states haha. I remember Delaparture and Oregone.
I saw Parasite. Subtitles yeah, but omg absolutely incredible 
I saw some fucking white kid at the BX today with a top knot and beard. Like what the fuck are we doing here
I saw some player say about Chapman that he used to have this mental edge since he was the only guy throwing 100+ every pitch. Now that it’s common, he’s lost that intimidation factor
I saw some statistics today that paint a cautiously optimistic picture that we’re approaching / have hit the inflection point
I saw something about a school trans sports bill pass state congress but get vetoed by the (republican) governor?
I saw somewhere that OL 1st round hit rates are really high in terms of getting a second contract with the drafting team. Every other position is low 
I saw that but what did rappaport do to draw the ire of #4?
I saw that earlier. One of the greatest quotes of the trump era 
I saw that movie like a dozen times. I would have zero idea what the lead actors name was
I saw that movie on a bus while abroad and had a huge crush on this girl hahahaha.  Also actually not a bad romantic comedy...
I saw that play lol but I don't remember anybody's name 
I saw the best reality TV show pitch on Reddit yesterday. Get this:
I saw the new one. 7/10. It’s a part 1 tho which I hate
I saw the same. A coward on multiple levels
I saw this episode a few days ago and I love this song 
I saw yesterday all the cruise companies are asking for a bailout, even though they’re all registered under Caribbean nations so they don’t have to abide by US taxes and employment law 
I saw. My default opinion is that all international agencies are feckless
I saw. They were in SF same time I was this past weekend but I didn't have time to say hello / am not a browns fan
I say argumentation before vocation
I say do what the default rules are. No reason to alter a players value based on whether or not they're the teams KR/PR
I say make all drugs legal and let eugenics run its natural course /s
I say make preseason 1 game
I say put it through then never again
I say the most irresponsible were the managers and the ratings agencies. Managers acted out of pure profit and knowingly screwed buyers (which isn't technically illegal). Ratings agencies seriously fucked up the very thing they were supposed to prevent. 
I say this because Putin has been playing the nuclear card incrementally for years now, because he knows it’s basically the only arrow he has in the quiver that generates headlines in the US, and is therefore the closest thing he has to an effective deterrent.
I say wtf I'm a grown fucking man I can take care of myself, he gets all offended and some bullshit. I just tell him to drop it
I say you’d win; likewise if he returns as the starter then Kyle Allen gets Covid week 12, is win
I screenshotted this looking to post it in the groupme, only to be elated that #ASMB to beat me to the punch
I see
I see holier-than-thou elitists looking down from their ivory tower on the hard working gritty souls of America
I see joe Kevin Jeff goody Katelynn and "espn29369435"
I see the rustling leaves but then what's
I see these responses and am now 99% sure we have done this before. 
I see what you're saying. I think that could've been helpful in the primary, but not in the general. Any presidential candidate's main goal is to win over the margins, and the blatant racism, recycled or not, will not help him win on the margins. That being said, it is possible him being exposed as a con artist would hurt him with the base, but I think those people won't be convinced about anything
I see you. But I'm for giving the advantage to 1) those who make the initiative, and 2) the seller. I don't think two people should make a deal, then have anybody else be able to one up
I see your stance and I agree with your intentions, but I don't trust the government to not fall down the slippery slope of Big Brother. 
I see. So yeah about equal. Better in QBR by 3.6, worse in PFF by 2.5
I see... You don't get the 10 CP easy candy Pokemon anymore?
I seent that one already and yeah I had a stroke and I’m seeing it agin so I mghrt br hvnfg aotber sorrtbsj Dfbsf
I share that sentiment but I don’t really know. However controlling a city/regions power is significant whether it’s nuclear or otherwise
I shaved my head two weeks ago because I got tired of doing my hair in the morning
I shit you not
I shit you not
I shot -1 (9 holes) and lost net by 4 strokes, lost match 2&0
I shot a 40 last weekend and I felt like a pro
I should be
I should be free any weekend, and I will likely have a car. 
I should be going to James party but probably not 
I should be okay but if you want a good back workout you're free to help 
I should change it to the Venmo pic tho because clearly it gives off “wow good pic” vibes
I should do yoga. I'm super inflexible
I should get a restraining order against him. Heard he's familiar with those...
I should lead with that on tinder 
I should make an IG for the Kelleher plan 🤔 
I should specify, more than normal
I should specify: at least one *more* hater. We all know there are haters exist in such quantity it’s difficult to count
I should start signing all my emails that way
I should watch tangled 
I should watch this show
I should’ve excluded him for this exact reason
I should’ve given you my 2010 Ping i20 when you were here
I showed the General that tweet after their big win lmao
I shower before bed tho so somehow I feel like that makes it a little better
I simultaneously think that most Accenture analysts worked far too many hours and their job could easily be done in 40 a week
I skimmed
I skimmed
I skimmed it. It's sensationalist Reddit bullshit with like 2 paragraphs of useful advice.
I skimmed most of the messages about the BC game. How did we look? Seemed stressful 
i skimmed, what tale?
I slack as much as I can without getting into trouble which is not as often as I'd like here at golddicks
I smell a Zach pick six
I smoke cigs because if anybody kills me, it's gonna be ME
I spy a new tinder pic
I squatted 225 once 💪🏼
I stand by calling it bullshit
I stand by it
I stand by it
I stand by that take btw
I stand corrected. Thank you for fact checking 
I stand there and chop like 5 pounds of chicken breast and Nick my fingers half the time, then chop broccoli and onions until I cry, then put it in the oven and be sad when I eat it
I started at 72k for perspective
I started S2 yesterday 
I stayed awake as long as I could. Going on mute and will watch the games spoiler less tomorrow
I still argue that the Kelleher Plan is totally feasible, while ethically questionable! But I see we've moved on. Don't know much about Medicare and Medicaid, other than the ACA's expansion of them.
I still believe that free trade is the best
I still can’t believe Marcus said he thinks redditors are good analysts. It’s literally the biggest uncritical circlejerking echo chamber ive ever seen. Reddit comment sections make fkn Twitter look like a hall of philosophers
I still can’t get over that they were on spring break during a literal civil war in their hometown 
I still can't believe Houston signed him before even holding a meeting 
I still can't believe this is real life
I still can't believe you made those shirts 😂
I still can't fucking believe it
I still can't get over the trade deficit tweet from this morning
I still choose CFP over the old format tho. Banking on Nevada to prevent a BYU undefeated season is dumb, even if it’s exciting.
I still disagree. You have a finite number of players so a player today doesn’t mean anything different if you have a cap. Why is a rookie this year better than Tate for a year and a rookie next year? 
I still don’t believe Jeff, but i suppose we’ll need to plan for it
I still don’t get it but thanks
I still don’t know why you hate the Herb, but do you like tua?
I still don’t understand the knife incident 
I still don't get laid though :(
I still don't know whether or not the players like Jeff fisher. I've heard multiple announcers say they love him, and there's never been any issues with players (beside Eric Dickerson). He just produces awful results every time
I still don't know why you blame me for that. It was completely Marcus's fault!
I still don't think it was a good idea to invade, but yeah the WMD thing is not why haha
I still go on few times a week but don't interact with anything 
I still hate Pete Carroll 
I still hate Sprint for the unskippable Sprint Halftime Show presented by Sprint in 2k14. I would hate it even more if it was “Remember to always use preferred pronouns!”
I still have time for a reattack when I come back 
I still have yet to figure out leg drive
I still lol’d 
I still love reading about lineal champs in MMA
I still maintain that betting the underdog at +700 in the NBA playoffs is a good bet every time 
I still plays Clash Royale 
I still say finna 
I still think hurts is far from a lock tho
I still think I could do it 
I still think I’d rather have any starting QB in the league over lock
I still think Kirk is better and we would have been at least as good with him. But also it’s dumb to not acknowledge the success we had with (or in spite of?) Jimmy
I still think Mitch is less bad than Lock 
I still think niners should trade it.  Too many major gaping holes to fill
I still think the Commies are retarded for the wentz trade
I still think the lockdowns are necessary 
I still think there is a ~50% chance Don doesn't finish his term so that adds another possible wrinkle
I still vote Becker
I still wanna hear final opinions from Emyr, Darrow, Kevin, and any other holdouts
I still wonder if the rumor that Shanny got bullied out of drafting Fat Mac was true
I stopped at 3
I strongly denounce all the innuendo about me going on here
I struggle with modern baseball more than I thought
I style can't believe I didn't know this guy until senior year
I subscribe to r/outoftheloop for these reasons
I suggested it a while back. You never agreed so it's of course not a done deal. What is your suggestion then?
I summon @Emyr Remy to weigh in
I support human torture
i support that, if i was running a business, those refusing to get a covid shot would be a good way of identifying the loonies
I suppose electoral votes is the tiebreaker
I suppose from a sales perspective they're similar, but from a drinking perspective, separate categories 
I suppose he could start "partnering" with restaurants, like if somebody goes to a restaurant and uses his Promo Code, they could get 20% off their meal, and he gets some portion of the sale?
I suppose he’s also good at rousing resentment amongst a certain portion of the country, but again, that’s 90% external 
I suppose I could read the article but nahhh
I suppose if you’re in win now mode and trying to strike gold again with that defense and a high risk offense, it makes sense. But I remember our conversations last year about how having a repeatedly terrible offense puts a ton of negative energy on the defense
I suppose it drives the point home that there’s some effed up stuff going on here and you should actively be aware of it
I suppose it’s not “morally wrong” just kinda adds an unfortunate requirement to the intimacy
I suppose it's about when you're taking your odds then
I suppose so. I'll take that as a condolence
I suppose that does give a different sort of color to it... that MA has a great public school system I mean
I suppose that makes sense in a weird sort of way
I suppose that should get its own claim: The 4.4 40
I suppose that would come down to play calling. So it would have to be a QB making selfish decisions
I suppose that's good news for those who want to leave the US for Canada
I suppose you could argue they “should” have been doing that already but like John said it’s a huge pain in the ass
I suppose. Generally If they're not referred to more than once, I pretty much write them off 
I sure hope it was the latter
i sure hope there are behavioral economists and financial academics studying the WSB phenomenon
I surprisingly haven't yet. But it's not like that was a hot take anyway
I survived
I swear 53 yard FG used to be like 50-50 like 10 years ago
I swear committing false flag operations on getting canceled by libs could be an incredibly lucrative brand strategy 
I swear fully understanding the NBA salary cap details is more difficult than half of college majors
I swear I thought those were water bears
I swear so much of football is not having enough tape
I swear this isn’t even lemon peppering. He looks like a straight up unathletic scrub in that video. Why would he post that
I swear to god Ryan Tannehill will never see my starting lineup again
I swear you guys purposely wait until I'm out of town to have these things
I switched teams literally today last year
I take back everything I said about the deal
I take back what I said about the Bills. I’m all in on the 🌿 and the ⚡️ 
I take Becker’s side easy
I take full responsibility 
I take Odell 
I take pride in phrase coining 
I take that as more negative than expected tho
I take umbrage with this
I taught @Skimmer how to corner the bowl for maximum efficiency. Fast forward a year and hes gets mad when other people torch it
I tell people I’m 6 negative 2
I tend to agree with Jeff but a decent take from PFT Commenter
I texted “big vaccine guy” in here so that was my announcement 
I texted him last week asking for an update and he told me to fuck off
I theorize it’s directly related to our generations’ America-skepticism and oikophobia
I think $61 marcus
I think “you wanna throw the ball?” is what I’ve said most
I think 1877Kars4Kids is all time bottom of the Power rankings
I think 2, one blue one gray, is good if you rarely wear suits like I do. I think a black suit is a even more special occasion specific
I think 2021 is clearly worse
I think 3 is most common. 5 would be above average. 
I think a $190 fine is punishment enough
I think a big man whose one dimension is great defense can fit
I think about that all the time when trump does something awful, and I think “what if Obama has done this”
I think about that at least once a week
I think Adele would kill it
"I think all 3 of you are cool 
( 👍🏼^_^)👍🏼"
I think all these football moves will have large impacts on the upcoming season
I think anybody who supports trump for trump (as opposed to not-Hillary) is an idiot
I think at least 2-3. You’re supposed to “enjoy” it, which as crazy as it sounds, does actually hold true for some people. And they make like $200k starting salary
I think Barry Bonds is bigger than Brady
I think baseball will go to it eventually and it will be an overall thing because it means the call will always be right
I think Bateman just called a ref a bitch ass n-word
I think becker and marcus takes here are both reasonable 
I think becker and me might’ve had more academic degrees between us than everybody else in there combined
I think becker is against both of those things so that might sway some folks toward the pro stance 
I think Becker’s right to start considering serious alternatives tho. There will continue to be positive tests, probably break outs, and therefore probably delayed games. You have to say that’s the most likely scenario.
I think Beckers got it locked up for the Fuckholiest Fuckhole 
I think Biden should have hit harder on the downplaying caught on tape
I think bidens gonna win Georgia wow
I think bill Coughlin and Danielle brazel should bang
I think billionaires should pay for their own fucking stadiums
I think Bobs Burgers is the best cartoon on TV right now 
I think books 2/3 were my favorite in juxtaposition with the show. Right amount of extra detail but still fast paced enough to keep me excited. Book 1 was great too but it was pretty closely mirrored by the show
I think Dak re-signs, Ders, and Thers stick with their guys. Jets and Jags are almost certainly drafting.  That leaves WFT, Colts, Pats, Broncos at least. Also not impossible (but not super likely) Stafford and Wentz get traded. Interesting to see how it plays out.
I think darrow is the only one who’s locked in
I think darrow would’ve won the Yahoo one
I think DBs might sneak in and take the cake
I think Diggs is a beast and clearly joe does too, and that's why it's so expensive
I think don is a moron. His best asset is his energy and ability to fire people up. He is very good at cultivating his own celebrity. But, he’s a moron/idiot in every sense of the word. NBC is more responsible for his reputation as a good businessman than even he is. Alone, I truly believe he’d fail at leading anything.  
I think doughnuts. I think I'd more likely be able to drink 24 beers than eat 24 doughnuts 
I think Drachman should be higher. He’s got that evil genius thing going on with the bald head, like he might poison your cat you if you cross him
I think each individual stock is priced by supply and demand on the exchange floor? I don’t really know tho actually good question
I think Eli Apple is the most hated-by-players player in the NFL
I think Emyr might be atop of the Pokemon Master Power Rankings
I think Fertittas want out, Dana will never leave if he has anything to say about it. Just a guess tho. 
I think FG attempt might have been the play
I think fields sucks but the implication of those trade values is debatable, at best
I think Fields sucks. I also think Zach Wilson sucks. And probably Trey Lance.
I think for Goodwin’s wedding gift we should all write letters writing off the pats. Truly nothing would make him happier. 
I think Gaga was the best
I think Gillian's island is an iconic TV show but not the character himself
I think goodwin gotta be the favorite. of the 3 engagees, Jeff and becker are too far away from making money. That’s my pick as long as goody isn’t on some “we actually don’t want kids” stuff
I think Goody just hates a certain kind of QB
I think goodys reasoning is dumb but I think the math does check out
I think google uses KC as their test market for everything, including Google Fiber
I think GoT legit ruined TV for me
I think green apple was the only one that was tolerable. Citrus was definitely bottom of the power rankings
I think Gronk is washed
I think guice is good and will have a decent year 
I think he certainly cared going in but threw in the towel as his performance was floundering and the Spurs lead grew 
I think he did as well as he possibly could’ve. So I’m inclined to believe the coaching was good enough to not screw him up. So yeah overall positive from a development perspective. 
I think he got it
I think he had max speed in backyard football
I think he has a good shot of that. I'm more concerned that he's not bombastic enough to sway the Trump supporters, where Cruz has clearly already targeted them 
I think he meant the big three, plus those guys lol 
I think he needs to shoot over par yeah. Not sure about DJ
i think he plays next season no matter what
I think he realizes he made a bad mistake and is trying hard to dig himself out
i think he regrets declaring he would pick a black woman, because Rice and Abrams are disasters, and people hate Harris
I think he released the initial batch and statement, said it was clean, then found this other shit and didn't know what it had, so he covered his ass with the republicans and made a statement they were reopening the case. Major freak out obviously. Then it's nothing, which it probably always was. 
I think he thought it was gonna go boom 
I think he tried to either keep the USSR together and/or mitigate the intra-Russian violence
I think he was in Brooklyn and didn't bother to say hey
I think he was life banned from asset management or something
I think he’s amazing but I can’t help but laugh when he does something FLB
I think he’s as bad as he’s made out to be
I think he’s played in a few pro tourneys 
I think he’s referring to becker 
I think he’s sort of a Yankees fan right?
I think Herbert is a slightly worse josh Allen 
i think he's better than Foles and Flip Rivers
I think I agree with darrow 
I think I agree with Marcus, but it’s a really bad look that SVB CEO sold $3.6 million 2 weeks ago AND that he lobbied for bank deregulation
I think I agree with you 
I think I also pull the lever
I think I ate at eagles nest the least of every dining option 
I think I broke 100
I think I could be a good golfer if I could figure it out
I think I could beat everybody in this group combined
I think I could do it in like 75 tries 
I think I could get a single hit in 600 PAs. Little flare Texas leaguer
I think I could give joe a run for his money 
I think I could hit 70
I think I could make 60
I think I did well except I forgot a lot of rules with geometry and exponents and stuff
I think I do Latina, Italian, Hapa as my top 3 in the power rankings
I think I eat bananas the most of any fruit but they're pretty meh
I think I found the hottest take on the fainting Hilldog story
I think I get access to a computer for taking notes but idk if I get internet access
I think I go red lobster, outback, and BWW
I think I go wolves and gorillas
"I think I go:
Hurts, TLaw, Herbert, Purdy, Dak, Stroud, Stafford, Tua"
I think I got to 40 but not 45. Maybe like 41-42 
I think I had a roommate like that...
I think I have the lowest StdDev of not only this league, but like any team ever
I think I have to
I think I just said *mwah*
I think I just won the bet
I think I left it short. I have a tendency to leave putts at a tap in but short
I think I like the heavier Xbox controller a bit more
I think I need to bulk to 185 to get there
I think I pick all QBs
"I think I put my athletic achievements as:
1) Regular top 10 pick in 3rd grade dodgeball
2) Eye contact with Luke Kuechly in dining hall 
3) Walkoff championship winning grand slam in BC intramural
4) Anklenbreaking crossover during pickup basketball when stationed in Texas 
5) FH Open reigning champion
6) Anything gordo related"
I think I rotate out Gobert and CP3 for Draymond and Jokic
I think I said like $500/10
I think I saw you jamokes taking a photo of this
I think I sit around 260-265 and if I swing hard and crush it it it’s 270-275
I think I take Arizona there...
I think I take Jones, then Darnold over all those guys. Jones is not great but has shown the highest ceiling. Darnold has been terrible but what goody said, and good HCs seem to still think he could have potential
I think I take the non-floss and wear dentures. Though darrow brings up a good point. Do I get tooth decay and gum disease?
I think I wait for him to get blackout drunk and pass out, then kick him in the head repeatedly
I think I was around 145 in college. And I was just over that after the AT. Now I’m around 170 (trying to get up to 175)
I think I’d beat you by 6 strokes at Augusta 
I think I’d choose Ayatollahstan over Beckerland 
"I think I’d disband Education, HUD, Labor, and VA. Maybe merge DHS with Defense too
"
I think I’d have a better shot against an crocodile than a chimpanzee 
I think I’d par all the 3s and 4s and shoot under on the 5s
I think I’d put him around 8? Like if I could hire anybody it would probably be be above Tomlin, after the Harbaughs. LaFleur and Shanny are close
I think I’d rather be a fan of the jags than the Texans tho right now. It’s possible I wouldn’t be saying that 12 hours ago lol
I think I’d switch Drachman and Kevin 
I think I’d top out at 75
I think I’m anti. I almost always side with the players over the teams. And yeah RBs get fucked because their career length is so short, but they’re not gonna be getting mega contracts anyway because they’re so replaceable. 
I think I’m at about $1500 positive
I think I’m between Thailand and Peru. The Peru trip I’m looking at starts in Lima and hits Nazca, Arequipa, Cuzco, and of course machu pichu. That sound like a good itinerary?
I think I’m gonna go 2014. Giants 3rd WS, Warriors 1st of this dynasty. Niners… 
I think I’m gonna start IG posting on the AT
I think I’m more against than for ranked voting at this point. It encourages people to play a political game more than show their true preferences, and also totally upends the whole popular vote thing (i.e. Dems win the National popular vote by X million, but CA had 2 Dems on the ballot)
I think I’m on board with that except replace LA Raiders with Atlanta or NO
I think I’m still near the top from my pre-USAF days 
I think I'd do 6 miles, 12 JOs, 18 doughnuts, 24 beers
I think I'd rather be glutarded than diabetic
I think I'd rather be lactose intolerant because if I couldn't drink beer that'd be pretty lame
I think I'd shoot at least 20%. And I'd just shoot from wherever the ball bounces. Top of the key ideally though
I think I'd take whoever is home in almost all of these matchups 
I think if he doesn’t make it a term, the most likely scenario is he gets frustrated and quits. Second is that he fires Mueller or Sessions so that the GOP abandons him, and then impeaches him. Third is the Dems take over and impeach him. Fourth is the GOP sees itself losing everywhere and blames him and impeaches him. 
I think if he doesn't finish, the most likely is he just gets fed up and quits, possibly if he continues to make deals with the Dems and right wing media turns on him
I think if he’s just normal asleep he wakes up and kills me
I think if I’m GAP I basically keep my ownership of Yeezy hush hush
I think if she adopts the Biden strategy - say as little as possible ever - that’s her smartest path
I think if the bears trade up it will be with the jags at 5
I think if the left and the right can start listening to each other's proposals and not instantly dismiss them as wrong, that will be a huge positive change in our sociopolitical culture
I think if we played scramble we'd shoot like +4. Playing from the blues not the tips
I think if you don't get the QB you want, you take DE / OLB both 1 and 2
I think if you say you identify as a chick, you're good to go
I think I'm gonna wait 4-6 months
I think I'm like a 12 fwiw
I think I'm not-fireable from an Accenture standpoint, but if I get rolled off the project thats really not a good look.  I think things are gonna work out okay and I'm not gonna have to roll off the project even if I admit it (considering the legality of it all), but I'm certainly not feeling safe about it right now.  I'm gonna call HireRight and see if a retest will be with a new sample, then go from there.
I think in a similar way that the best hockey players come from Canada/Russia/Sweden/whatever but they all want to play in the NHL 
I think Istanbul would be really cool but time might be up for that one
I think it favors Rs. Despite the presence of the 👸, women tend to vote D and lol @ women. I think white men are the sweet spot of both vote R and ability to chuck it up and probably hit the rim
I think it had to do with the NFL being the most unwilling to buck conventional wisdom (until the past 2/3 years). There was an article I read once that said madden players made better decisions than NFL coaches
I think it is undeniable that athletics is paramount to 1) BC’s identity, 2) attracting prospective students, and 3) alumni donations
I think it is, deserved or not
I think it might be better to use the DL strengths and play single high; rush 5+ most plays, and try to force quick throws and contested catches before tyreek burns you
I think it sets a bad precedent because of the rental thing, not because of the PV FV
I think it should be legal if you want to; You don't have to have a great reason, it's just not the govts to stop someone from committing suicide.  
I think it was “auction dollars should not be available for trade”
I think it was a mouse
I think it was after Erin’s rant about DACA and I asked “wait so is this the fault of the patriarchy or evil republicans or spineless democrats?” 
I think it was BC alums at Accenture who reached out to me so that would make sense
I think it was him. Somebody complained about not receiving one and I assumed you were that persons secret Santa. 
I think it was the ammo conservation being so important at literally every point in the game
I think it was through the manager/player vote 
I think it will be 5.5 or 6 
I think it will be Klob
I think it will die before it’s users literally die because that’s like 50 years. Like ~10 years I could see a world where it’s on the outs, but I don’t know how
I think it would backfire tremendously but I certainly could be wrong
I think it would be bad for the party and bad for democracy, because it would signal that the party establishment trumps the will of the voters. Thus far Ryan has repeatedly said he has zero interest but we'll see if that changes. 
I think it would be similar to the dominant dual threat college QB’s first game in the NFL. The moment they realize they can’t just juke or run over every defender is great to watch 
I think it’s a basically a private company shipper who can be contracted by the DOD when needed
I think it’s a type. Narcissistic snake oil salesmen that have a cult following: Bernie, Trump, Elon
I think it’s about not wanting to give an hostile warmongering and possibly paranoid leader of a nuclear power any further reason to be on on edge 
I think it’s basically the price of a futures contract. Correct with the third column.
I think it’s close. I’ve watched a lot of Niner games. Jimmy G is a solid QB especially when he’s got an awesome D and backfield schemes, but he’s not a playmaker. Allen has more playmaker in him
I think it’s fine if its to be used as designed
I think it’s just a video of her claiming she got bukkaked by the suns
I think it’s just called the bebop?
I think it’s just true odds then take a cut off the top
I think it’s kinda implicit that part of the of the goal of LIV is “fuck the PGA”. The Saudi blood money is icing on the cake
I think it’s largely because I walk significantly less living at home. In NY I’d walk a brisk 3 Miles to and from work every day
I think it’s like an equal chance that he beats me as there is a chance I beat him by 12 strokes
I think it’s marry kellyanne, fuck boebert, kill MTG. Nothing else is close to better
I think it’s only fair that I get a whip (Indiana Jones of course) against Goodwin and Frankie, and a 9 iron against Marcus
I think it’s only the ones he applied to? When he went on his interview tour in October-November 
I think it’s plausible that expensive art (including NFTs) are used to launder money
I think it’s probably a negative in the general
i think it’s probably the past the time to defend trump and his insurrectionists
I think it’s real
I think it’s recency bias and/or high profile SNF matches. I mean it’s basically just Jets, Jags, NFC East
I think it’s smart. Whenever you deal with a coworker for the first time and you can see their title, you have to assume they’re the highest sublevel of that title 
I think it’s terrible. The fact that half dome doesn’t have an elevator is extremely fatphobic. 
I think it’s time the FH admit we’re in an abusive relationship with Joe
I think it's average of your best 25% of rounds or something 
I think its because I’m sleeping more, and my first meal is way later in the day
I think it's both. Increases chances both when moving and when still, and since moving already increases chances, it's prob even higher
I think it's buns
I think it's deceiving that military spending is called discretionary spending, while entitlements and benefits are considered non-discretionary
I think it's easier, i feel like the treadmill sets an unnatural pace
I think it's just the highest one
I think it's just Trumps prolonged success that makes things look so bad. If Rubio was polling at 40%, I doubt anybody would be saying that
I think it's similar to the masters 
I think it's so ironic that fiscal conservatives care about economic sustainability but not ecological sustainability, and liberals are the opposite
I think it's time for us to step up Fuckholes. Since joe won't apply despite his obvious qualifications, we need to write and submit his application for him
I think I've unfollowed and re-followed Clay Travis more than any other account on Twitter
I think James had just gone to Costco or something
I think Jed York might not be the absolute worst owner in sports...
I think Jeff knows the Patriots better than I know any individual team 
I think Jeff should be the league Skip Bayless while he sits out this year
I think JFF there 4 picks in the CFL that same day 
I think joe and goody could get all of us (girls included) Idk about anyone else
I think Joe is just salty because Bourque Bros Asset Mgmt went down the tubes today
I think John could be Ryan 
I think John is in the lead with me and goody close behind 
I think John would be “horny vagrant”
I think Johnsons been a head case for a while. Had that weird balloon up from 170 to 205 out of nowhere. Now he's retiring in the height of his career. I don't get it
I think Jordan Hicks and Aroldis Chapman are the only ones who’ve recorded 105 in baseball history
I think Judge can hit a baseball further than I can drive a golf ball
I think Julio + Lucks price / 2
I think Kevin said 8 at earliest. @Skimmer✅✅ Can you confirm? Then obviously John is kinda gonna be screwed with late night no mayyet what. Otherwise I think we have no constraints 
I think Khabib would destroy him...
I think Kobe gotta be there as #8
I think Kobe is in a similar situation (not about his guilt per se)
I think last time I plugged South Park and bobs burgers and you said you were daunted by how many episodes there were, so I’ll re-plug those since you clearly have time
I think late add goody or me
I think lawyers jobs is the most at risk tho
I think Mario batali ended up being named
I think Maz would be tolerable and entertaining. Wu sucks but compared to the others... man 
I think Mike Tyson is the most normal tiger owner in the country
I think mine are 1) getting rejected by a girl in 8th grade and the whole class was talking about it for weeks, and 2) losing a meet deciding wrestling match to a big rival when I was winning by 8 points and messed up a far side cradle and got pinned
"I think mine are
1. Peyton
2. Andrew Luck
3. Jason Kidd
4. KD (pre warriors)"
I think Minnesota might be my favorite 
I think montgomery is not as shifty as he thinks he is. Good at powering through tackles tho. 
I think more than keeper value is not a problem because the player could already be kept at the keeper value, no matter how much anybody else will pay. See OBJ
I think most mildly in shape people are breaking 6?
I think most people are knocking it for the whole Finn storyline which was literally pointless. But I don’t think anybody hated the Rey story
I think much of the bills mafia endearing-ness comes from the fact that Buffalo is tiny compared to every other city with a sports team 
I think my analogy holds up pretty well given both the above comments 
I think my answer is, probably? Like you’re prob not gonna root for a divisional or cross town rival
I think my favorite are the “die hard” football fans who don’t know the positions
I think my favorite part is “Hey you’re serving while claiming you didn’t! That’s stolen valor! “
I think my favorite take of the month is WBC is stupid because players should be in spring training, but also baseball doesn't matter until September anyway. 
"I think my revised list is: 

Reid
Harbaugh 
Harbaugh
KOC
Campbell
McVay
Payton
Shanahan
LaFleur
Tomlin 
McDermott
Zac Taylor
Stefanski"
I think New Jersey is the most underrated stare 
I think nobody wants that
I think not too much. People were pissed at the botched execution
I think odds are 55-45 Biden at the moment
I think one of the biggest failures in communication has been that talking/yelling/singing is a major factor. If you keep your mouth closed, the risk of transmission goes way down. Which might explain why airplanes and even movie theaters are not high risk
I think options trading is so popular because it's basically gambling, but you feel like a genius when you get it right, whereas with gambling you are forced to admit you got lucky
I think our best performance of the season was the first game 17-14 loss to GTech 
I think our minds were Cubs + 20, 20 Ks, 20 Ws
I think outback and red lobster are ok quality. And chili’s burgers aren’t bad
I think over saturation is a factor but not as big as Cuban thinks, and I think No Fun League is insignificant 
I think Pablo achmed Dante
I think part of what makes Mets fans cool is that they also hate the Yankees
I think Penix or Bonix are strong possibilities because I think they’re gonna trade down and throw shit at the fan at QB
I think PFT and Big Cat are funny. Portnoy and KFC are losers
i think poirier takes it. he's a real fighter, idk if mcgregor is anymore
I think private businesses can refuse service to anyone but like in a public place it’s now unenforceable. That’s my understanding 
I think Purdy vs Herbert is pretty close, which is wild to say
I think Pythagorean record could be improved if you cap single game points delta at like 28
I think RB is the position id like to play least. You fucking dominate in high school and college, then go to the NFL where you get beat up every touch, have to block like crazy, and you're lucky if you have a 4 year career
I think red alert 2 was my favorite
I think Rodney Hood is real solid, and nance is underrated too. Agree on IT, he had one great season but is not really an above average player
I think ronda Rousey deserves an honorable mention. Pacquiao too maybe
I think Rubio is officially anti-gay marriage, but I highly doubt he would overturn any gay marriage edicts passed under Obama. Don't really know about the rest other than that he's a Cuban lol
I think rules played a factor for John. Which if true would mean 3 people. It’s clearly a factor for darrow now, and I am not a fan either. Idk about Emyr.
I think running + beers would be the hardest
I think Shanny wants a RPO every snap system. Im nervous lance isn’t reactive/decisive enough to implement that, even if he is talented enough (also a question mark)
I think she’s a conspiracy theorist before being elected and has leaned further into it because of the QAnon popularity and stuff 
I think shes a lot more in line with the Hillary voters than the Bernie voters, and she’s trying to buzzword out the Bernie voters because they do seem to like buzzwords a lot
I think shohei is gonna face a pretty lengthy suspension sooner or later. 
I think significant portions of the far left have severe antisemitism problems. As does the far right. 
I think Skip has a shot!
I think Slayton is the real deal
I think smith is middle of the pack
I think so Goody. Which is why the GOP was worried trump would do so
I think so. It’s possible tony could’ve stolen 2 with that last second drop but he shouldn’t IMO
I think so? He was like a genius thief kid?
I think Star Wars was my fav movie of the year 
I think Sunset Grill is the only place I've ever eaten in Boston
I think that might be a fumble 
I think that model is very flawed. And The 538 crew thinks so too.  I’d be curious to see what their actual thoughts are on probability ranges
I think that tweet is about as classy as it gets from him
I think that was from 1-2 years ago tho
I think that’s #1 on tiktok
I think that’s a main point that it weans out a lot of those who don’t like it 
I think that’s largely bogus tbh. I think it’s far more antifa. But I would say with certainty Russia will try to exploit this possibly by urging right wing groups to do exactly that
I think that’s largely splitting hairs at this point. You agree that the definitely mentally unstable shouldn’t buy guns
I think that’s my favorite FH gif
I think that’s my favorite photoshop
I think that’s navy blue. And I think it’s sweet
I think that’s technically imperialism
I think that’s Texas A&M
I think that’s why I would fail in politics 
I think that's a huge reason why kuechly is so good. He's amazing at reading the play and keeping himself in it
I think that's fine for all except maybe RB, just since there's been so much streaming
I think that's grammatically correct?
I think that's the most self aggrandizing thing I've ever heard. Like the Maz posts don't hold a candle to that
I think the “open the economy” position was so dumb for the administration to take
I think the 90s graphic design styles have aged the worst
I think the Bernie voters really really hate Hillary. Perhaps Cruz is savvy enough to sway some of them
"I think the best marketing use case is:
“Would you rather use a book for -110 odds on both sides, or use FriendZone and get even odds?”"
I think the best part of the whole thing was learning that there are somehow like 10% of people who do “the emyr”
I think the biggest school vs real world difference is the minimum paper length requirements. In the real world, literally write as few words as possible. Bullets are better than paragraphs most of the time
I think the coaching edge in the NFL is still so much of a difference maker compared to the MLB and NBA that is supersedes a GM edge. 
I think the compasses are fun but missing a ton 
I think the crack addicts should take lessons from sad junior enlisted 
I think the Cubes is saying there aren't enough doctors, so make more doctors by increasing med school spots and therefore acceptances. 
I think the discourse we have in here is admirable and wish it was the norm 
I think the fact that there was so much “WTF” by the media even at that time gives credibility to it being a true WTF move
I think the Falcons needed to dump his whole salary in order to sign their draftees
I think the fats can usually do more pull ups than chin ups 
I think the full caption should be “Bock with a Glock: Double Action, Double Chin”
I think the hawks are the only ones that can kill the rats. But not before they kill you
I think the last reality TV I watched more than 1 episode was actually jersey shore season 2
I think the latter
I think the military is actually the lowest qualification job that somehow still gets prestige 
I think the most likely scenario is employers cut the number of min wage employees significantly to offset the rise in costs as much as possible
I think the nationalization of CFB has made local recruiting way less important. And currently the SEC teams have the best programs, fans, and paths to the NFL so that’s where the recruits go
I think the new head of the NCAA is some retired Air Force general
I think the only way I score a TD is if my offense got me down to the 1, then inexplicably subbed me in at QB, and I threw a 50/50 ball. 
I think the pats fans view the pats similar to how we all view BC
I think the pitch clock in the majors is a bigger deal
i think the president has zero effect on gas prices, or most things economic in general
I think the problem is I’m opening my left hip early making me pull shots especially off the tee
I think the singing stuff is accurate but personalities are just too different
I think the Syrian war made people realize maybe George Bush wasn’t the most evil person in the world 
I think the track man is shaving yards 
I think their biggest problem is the scheduling of the air crews, crew rest requirements, inbound/outbound aircraft, and gate spaces when a flight is canceled or diverted. Which is something that could be very much aided by AI so let’s hope that works out.
I think there are macro trends that many NFL coaches appear to be failing at. Like presnap motion appears to be a no brainer “do it every time” thing. I am not sure that our X and Os knowledge would be immediately better.  
I think there was a study that said free for all boarding is just as fast as any of the organization attempts
I think there’s a decent shot some gun legislation occurs in the next few years because there is bipartisan support for it
I think there’s a formula 
I think there’s a higher chance that we die than tackle him
I think there’s a legit chance the Saudis get bored of LIV and pull the plug in a few years
I think there’s a max messages before you have to pay
I think there’s a pretty big gap between the chiefs and the #2 team
I think there’s a solid chance Elon reverses the decision
I think there’s like 10,000
I think they are, minus their pre-1991 history of getting fucked sideways by different empires. But I don't think they're too different than Ukraine in that there are a lot of pro-Russians there, and that a Ukraine-like Russian intervention might do serious harm to internal stability
I think they both 1) “deserve” it by being good, and 2) don’t want my team to invest heavily into an RB because their value above replacement is rarely worth it 
I think they do the AAV +- 1-5 RNG 
I think they gave them the card for best actress
I think they got nasrallah 
I think they have 3 days
I think they should reschedule the chiefs game 
I think they showed this graphic just to rub it in
I think they stay out of it as much as possible, but if they had to choose, i think they’d support Israel
I think They Terk Er Jerbs is number one for me
I think they’d be half decent
I think they’ll call the race for Biden tonight 
I think they’re are a lot and he just lapped the field with all of them this season  
I think they’re doing average
I think this debate is probably pointless tbh
I think this is a major overreaction
I think this is different 
I think this is the 2nd best Chan photoshop of all time 
I think this person was created in a lab to give @The Big Dick Bandit  the fuel for his takes
I think this takes the cake as dumbest argument of all time
I think this was a bad answer. Should've been more aggressive here
I think this was a final jeopardy question before
I think those were the original 2 sports. Fighting and running. 
I think Tim Ryan gonna lose 😢 
I think Titans and Rams take the cake
I think travelocity and it’s competitors do stuff like that?
I think Trump is sick of Bannon not kissing his ass and instead doing his own thing. Unrelated to the racism stuff, ironically enough
I think UFC is perfect except maybe the 185 to 205 gap is too much
I think we all do, but I'd rather take the slow and steady course there than play the lottery
I think we continue to go all in with lance for at least next year
I think we could do it with 3
I think we got half of them with no help?
I think we got the 2nd FH Open in the bag
I think we just killed baghdadi 
I think we might have passed the peak of the third wave. Cautious with reporting lags as always 
I think we need to add a wager to Fuckhole open? Becker how many strokes would you give Joe in skins?
I think we need to set a date for that btw
I think we should buy becker a life size cardboard cutout of Tiger for his birthday 
I think we should spend the day appreciating our love of shortening and intergalactic household items
I think we should’ve added a third flex
I think we’ll be ok against New Orleans 
I think we’re averaging like 1.5/8 of the elite 8
I think what happened to the jags is reminiscent of 2016 giants. Great defense that got disheartened by terrible offensive play game after game
I think with skins it could be close
I think worse than the milo banning is the censoring of the #DNCLeak hashtag. Twitter removed it from trending topics 
I think yes
I think you “can’t” because the studios refuse to
I think you also get "freerolls" like once a week
I think you can create an iCloud account and see it through that
I think you can go faster on a treadmill, but I think if you're running long distance, it's better to run at a non-machine set pace
I think you can't do anything that you already know the result of
I think you could too
I think you have to split the money, the title cannot be split
I think you have to trade on margin to short by definition
I think you have to use the morning wood to knock out at least 2 JOs off the bat
I think you just like being in group texts that are meaninglessly exclusive
I think you should go for it on 4th around midfield a lot more than is currently being done
I think you’re expected to do a 60 hour work week like every week until you die tho. The 80+ is 2-3
I think you’re just salty about Marlon Mack 
I think you’re misunderstanding. Do they know what video film is?
I think you're gonna be okay
I thought 1 2 and 3 were awesome, fluff and all. It was lots of background history on the Targaryens and Starks and the like. 4 and 5 were mostly fluff, and the fluff stories were random people who were pretty much meaningless. Hell even some of the main character chapters seemed to have no point too. "let's check in with Jon Snow. Yep, he's still at the wall, making tough decisions."
I thought about rats but I think the wolves would have a field (mouse) day with them
I thought about that too but I think end rushers are more important because they affect both the running and passing game
I thought all of those movies were very compelling watches that were ruined by the ending
I thought boot camp was gonna be more running so I came in with a fair amount of training. 
I thought Clinton was gonna win too, and win big. Turns out there were more angry white people than anybody thought. Obama's tenure (again not blaming him per se) made these angry white people come out in troves to vote. 
I thought cold take meant obvious
I thought everything is auto withheld, then you get it back in the return depending on your net annual income
I thought Fedor was super overrated even before his terrible transition to the American leagues
I thought gyarados was water/dragon, but then my starmie's power gem (rock) was super effective, so I remembered it was water/flying. Then the exeggcutor came up and my pinsir's bug attack was super effective and I remembered it was good against grass and/or psychic
I thought he just got a DUI or something?
I thought he was basically Black Panther, but baaaaaaad
I thought he was making fun of you Joe haha
I thought he was on the bills bandwagon?
I thought his nickname was “I’m Doug Martin”
I thought I couldn’t find bigger TB12 stans than in the Hotel. I was wrong 
I thought I read he wants to get into digital journalism, and working on new ways of presenting news to the masses
I thought I read that like 70% of students taking these classes were athletes
I thought I remember seeing that starting at level 20, all wild Pokemon will have the same max CP (not controlling for IVs). Or something like that. Can anyone else confirm?
I thought I remembered the story as more funny and less ugh-worthy 
I thought I’d have posted more. There isn’t much to do here in the gordo. And I usually have groupme pulled up on my web browser 
I thought it got shut down?
I thought it was a bills fan hanging herself joke
I thought it was bandwagonning communist 
I thought it was cool how English speakers love the Premier League and Spanish speakers love La Liga
I thought it was cum tissue
I thought it was funny
I thought it was gonna be like some new Kay Adam’s or Molly MgGrath
I thought it was grab rim?!
I thought it was ok until the rap part
I thought it was pretty funny lmao
I thought Kanye’s was kinda meh. Not bad but a just meh
I thought literally nobody would defend Lebron here, but goodwin you surprise me yet again
I thought Mayor Pete by far the strongest in the primaries, and Warren second. I thought Cruz and Rubio were solid last time
I thought my Instagram wasn’t loading pictures for a few minutes
I thought of him just because I know the name but I had no idea what his stats were lol
I thought our team was supposed to be a low expectations team, not a team with almost 50-50 odds of a playoff run
I thought our testing capacity had largely flatlined?
I thought palpatine ordered the clone army
I thought Red Tails was by far the best
I thought Rivera had a bit much of a going away tour but people said he was such a great guy that he deserved it
I thought someone posted in here about it about a week ago 
I thought that was a catch
I thought that was a catch fwiw. I also thought the Dez play was a catch, and the Calvin Johnson play
I thought that was a troll...
I thought the bet was if Paxton was gonna be the opening day starter
I thought the first half went about as well as you could ask for the broncos 
I thought the fuckholes loved Eminem 
I thought the point wasn’t to skate past the first 2 gyms, but to be the best no one ever was 🤔 
I thought the second down play was a TD
I thought the Sox blew it in the 6th
I thought they called themselves Team Toast
I thought they got wayyyy more
I thought they were also demolishing the plex and mods and putting something there? 
I thought this episode was a good story but not particularly funny. Still solid tho
I thought this was about intimidation factor tho 
I thought this was gonna be a JT breakout week
I thought this was very smart 
I thought Tom Herman had a really good quote on the whole issue 
I thought trump exceeded (very low) expectations. Thought Hillary wasn't aggressive enough. Most commentary I've read says Trump was terrible and Hillary was solid. 
I thought Up was overrated
I thought Washington and Burr were the best by far 
I thought we agreed in Nashville it’s because it’s so controversial, ie he’s not outright trash 
I thought we agreed you can't keep Bell or OBJ
I thought we hated herzlich as of 2 days ago?
I thought we just agreed we don’t want that
I thought you didn’t know the Santa’s 🤔 
I thought you had a typo
I thought you hated chopped because of the frickin kids
I thought you said "I bet Paxton will be game 1 starter" and I said I'll take that bet
I thought you told us Angela’s friends were dead 🤔 
I thought you were gonna link Don demanding the USS John McCain be out of sight when he visited Japan
I thought zombies seeked you out too 
I told everybody that Amex chose to go a different direction with their strategy and my implementation role was no longer needed. So far nobody has called me out on it. 
I told you right after the Celtics beat the Hawks and advanced to the Eastern Conf semis
I too have been recruited by tik tok
I too loved the Zionist rants
I too want to know when the Fuckholes Open is happening since Joe ruined the first option
I too would like to imagine that was the case 
I took a bunch of pre workout and bought a rack to reorganize my tools, because I gotta get all pumped up to go hang the vice
I took a huge hit when there was a bong in front of me
I took at least 3 years off my life raging at MW2
I took BP today. 60 mph from 45 feet. I regret to report that (amongst many barrels) I swung and missed several times
I took Emz James and Pomps to my favorite Chinese restaurant in San Mateo. The beef noodle soup was too spicy for all of them but they all loved the dumplings
I took second in the combatives tourney in my weight. Lost in the finals to a guy who wrestles college. #bragbrag but I’m proud 
I tooootally would've started Cards D but he talked me out if it 
I totally disagree Marcus 
I traded Diggs to Joe for something that included next years auction dollars, a brilliant and pioneering move. This set the stage for wild conversation of PV vs FV, and spiraled into a several year domino effect of mega tanking. The last trade was John making some shenanigans trade before quitting the league like 2 weeks later. 
I tried but they said I can't because it would hurt their graduation rate and graduate employment % rate 
I tried to click on it but I couldn’t
I tried to fit gronk but having moss and Megatron was too tough to cut
I tried to leave but I failed. I'm in an abusive relationship with a SJW site
I tried to pick average size dudes
I tried. It was paywalled
I truly don’t know if he’s the most delusional or the most dishonest person of all time. It’s honestly sad. 
I truly envy your selective memory abilities 
I try to be pretty reasonable with takes and I’ve seen enough to formulate an opinion that CRT is retarded
I turned it off 30 seconds into Trevor Noah’s opening to turn on womens college basketball. True story. 
I understand and I agree with you in principle. But this is an uphill battle with a very very very small reward, and most likely ends in a bitter stalemate
I understand that line of thinking and I think a LOT of millennials will be voting the same. Same thing I'm doing with McMullin, more of a symbolic vote than actually wanting/trying to win. I agree with many Libertarian ideas too but as a party these dudes are but jobs 
I understand what’s special about Belgian fries
I unfollowed sports center on IG a while ago because it’s literally zero sports now
I unfortunately agree
I unfortunately agree Warriors is a joke and Cowboys missing is a surprise.  Pats is absolutely not though
I unfortunately don’t talk to any of them anymore. Kiera is actually getting married like next week in Alexandria VA, I was not invited. But emyr is going  
I unironically agree with this 
I unsubbed a while ago lol
I use my moms Amazon prime card haha
I use sql every day. Joins, where exists, and substrings are 90% of my queries
I use the fuck out of seat geek. 538 podcast gives promos for it too.
I used the pee scale in a semi pickup line on Friday 
I used to actually dislike her but now that I haven't seen her in like a year, it's more fun just to talk shit
I used to be a telemarketer. You spend all day sitting there while the phone auto dials repeatedly and <10% of your calls are answered. It's miserable
I used to be able to say that I’ve had every candy they sell at 7-11. Big Candy had to go out and invent more candy so now I can’t say that anymore
I used to laugh at Egypt for their failed democracy in the wake of the Mubarak ousting. Turns out America would likely be the same
I used to like this one because it meant “let’s end this fucking meeting”
I used to think I wasn't offended by anything. I've learned I was wrong
I used to think India was the best long term target for an alliance (population, economic growth, hatred for China and Pakistan) but now idk. They have shown a propensity to play whatever side is best for them in the short term and I don’t think they can be counted on. Their Abstention from condemning Russia at the UN is an example of this. I think India would rather be the next china than be an ally of the west. Long answer for “idk” but those are my thoughts. 
I used to until they got fucked on by the fun police aka the gubmint. Emz plays a lot, mostly bball, and I'm pretty sure he wins more than he loses. 
I usually do $25 triple up: top third triples your bet
I usually do black with 1 sugar
I usually do the end of workout deal too but today I did a cardio and abs day and I think I'm gonna start more of that 
I usually get between 12-18 on Jeopardy, then 7-11 on Double. And am like 20% with final haha
I usually go dry but occasionally use lotion or Vaseline
I usually go with the sirloin but occasionally I’ll get a T bone
I usually hate Philly sports fans, but this guy is a legend
I usually hit the approach 90% on that hole but the tailwind made me change
I usually try to get a game of hearthstone in
I vaguely remember but not more than that 
I volunteer to be the trial run next weekend
I vote cage match
I vote deadline prior to the Thursday game 2 weeks before fantasy playoffs start. No trades whatsoever after that
I vote FH trip in the fall. But to Boston. For a BC game and other Foxtrot Hotel activities. 
I vote for joe Bourque as groupme dictator (yes I’m aware of the irony)
I vote keep it
I vote Peyton. Only QB in NFL history to win a super bowl with 2 different teams. Cut his career in half and have two hall of fame careers. Drinks Budweiser and likes Papa Johns like a true red blooded American. Pisses off Shaun King and the SJW community. Just a 🐐 in every aspect of life. 
I vote we make a rule though about inseason rentals
I vote we redistribute time from Joe to Kevin, since joe has so much and Kevin doesn’t have enough
I vote we reset if we can guarantee 10
I voted yes
I wanna be a fly on the wall for his interactions with the Ivy Hill gentlemen
I wanna be in the room when the FH tell @BC Football (6-6) about all these clowns
I wanna be the first to congratulate Ryan darrow on his Fantasy Fuckholes championship. Enjoy your $150 winnings
I wanna be the guy who checks the pulse of somebody who just collapsed and says "he's dead". 
I wanna come but it's so tough without a ride :/
"I wanna get back to the Joff Solution: 

My solution is to cap the price of medical treatments, require insurance to reimburse up to a minimum percent, and allow hospitals to negotiate costs with drug companies and insurance companies. "
I wanna get really high and marathon watch the 1966 Batman 
I wanna go to India 
I wanna go to Israel. Thanks for the invite 
I wanna hear @Jamie Bourque and @The meat chef ‘s mocks 
I wanna hear a C#- major scale
I wanna hear the Chris Chan shit list
I wanna hear the conversation that led to the cease and desist to poke vision. Like it made the game more popular, what reasons did they have for shutting it down?
I wanna know the backstory behind the hat
I wanna root for goff but fuck the Rams 
I wanna say harpers deal was the biggest but i think those contracts are backloaded
I wanna see @Mac America Great Again rankings
I wanna see Erin debate a female who is pro traditional gender roles
I wanna see Floyd Mayweather vs Morris Claiborne in a Wonderlic-off
I wanna see Lavar Ball vs Skip Bayless
I wanna see the salaries of all congressmen cut in half
I wanna shoutout Dr. Thompstein for accurately refuting a sepsis diagnosis 
I want @Skimmer to weigh in
I want a blank slate baby, and I'll write your name
I want a fuckholes risk affinity-aversion power rankings. Jeff clearly laps the field in most averse
I want a neutral course
I want an RG3 30 for 30
"I want BC to be good at 3 things, in order:
1) Academic ranking
2) Athletic performance in football/basketball
3) College life for the common student

With 1, they seem like they're more or less the same, but I would focus on the strengths of CSOM and also publicize the focus on CS/IT. 2 speaks for itself... 3 seems to be fine, but I was always irked by all the admin bullshit (which prompted me to join RHA, where I just got more frustrated). Point is I don't see them improving in any of those 3 areas and I don't see a working strategy in place to do so in the near future. "
I want Brooke and Taylor (and possibly others) to come out, so I'm checking with them. That's my only real constraint. Also prefer not Neds 
I want Darrow to hatefuck her so hard
I want handouts from you regardless of how tough the times are
I want individual item sequences 
I want Miami to lose but no way that’s a TD
I want Michigan in the playoff
i want more songs of the year lists!
I want my HR Derby to be consecutive absolute nukes. I don’t care about home many HRs in the time limit. Whatever system can get that result is the one I want. 
I want the Broncos to win and then witness someone - anyone - seriously tell Jeff that Peyton is better than Brady, and watch the ensuing shitshow
I want this to happen so bad
I want to do something fun and different. Foxwoods is in a convenient location.
I want to go on vacation and can do so pretty much whenever I want but I'm terrible at planning so if someone has a cool trip I'm interested
I want to hurt things
I want to know @Jeff Savarino thoughts
I want to know if they’d strip the title from Houston 
I want to know what anesto thinks of Lavar ball
I want to know what percentage of the positive cases are concentrated in places like nursing homes, or a single church or something. Would give color to how widespread the virus is amongst the general public.  
I want to peoples elbow him
I want to see him play to watch him fail.
I want to see the pile of guns!
i want to short GME so bad but dont want the risk
I want to take them to small claims court, but that might require me burning a vacation day
I want you to bet the over on BC. I like when people put their money where their mouths are (even if it isn't me on the receiving end)
I want you to go ❤️ 
I wanted Emyr to say it himself ;)
I wanted him back
I wanted him, but since I know you’re looking for a bench RB I thought he’d be your guy for sure
I wanted to see Fences but haven't
I wanted to see the FB thread and see the fallout from your comment, if there was any
I wanted to test myself today. I did 8. 
I was #TeamBecker and hyping hard!
I was 15/30
I was a huge MMA fan from like 2007-2012. I thought Brock coming in and getting gifted a title shot against 40 year old 220 pound Randy Couture was total bullshit (still think this), and I hated his personality
I was a khajeet stealth guy (forgot the names of the actual classes). But pretty much every mission I would go in the dark, use nighteye, and rely totally on pickpocketing and stealth attacks. If I ever got into open combat I was fucked
I was a Khajeet stealth thief (don't remember the exact class name) in Oblivion. Almost never was in open combat. 
I was a knots and lashings expert  
I was a telemarketer and greens keeper 
I was about to extol your virtues 
I was about to say that
I was about to share this lmfao
I was A-ing Darrow's Q
I was all in until the swastika post and Freemason shit
I was also taught that Columbus was a revolutionary thinker for thinking the earth was round
i was and am still extremely surprised
I was at a wedding this weekend and my suit pants were tight. First time I felt like a fatso in my life
I was at the chute packing shop when I saw this and that was kinda cool, because I said “some AFE troop just saved that guys life” surrounded by AFE troops, and I think it meant something to these ~20 year old chute packers
I was at the gym and then having a beer on the patio. Also we saw each other like 3 weeks ago
I was banging the drum for the Ners to sign Kirk back when he was a FA
i was being sarcastic haha
I was close lol
I was confused too but i spent hours verifying, and it turns out the quick maths is accurate
I was considering an “in b4 darrow is already a dad”
I was considering KD, Draymond, and personal favorite Jamal Crawford 
I was corroborating your assumption
I was crying laughing hahaha
I was diligently counting calories and macros except for the 11 days on vacation. I knew I’d lose some muscle but I’m just unpleasantly surprised at how much strength I lost 
I was disappointed there weren’t more Build your team for $15 discussions 
I was disappointed when I couldn't give myself dreadlocks
I was down $38.50 going into this weekend. Went 3-0 on niners spread and money line +185, and Houston spread
I was even through 14 too
I was following in the car on fantasy cast. Spotty reception. All of a sudden I see "you have 20 groupme notifications"
I was going to propose a boxing tournament
I was gonna aks a trivia but don't wanna spoil "book not show, but it would have already happened" in case we were doing that
I was gonna do a random number generator 
I was gonna guess Baez! Cubs love him for some reason and they obviously are on a fan craze right now
I was gonna guess gianpietro 
I was gonna guess justice too
I was gonna nominate you for r/prequelmemes of course
i was gonna say "vis a vis less progressive Dems" but i wouldve had to kill myself
I was gonna say I thought Chastain and Hamm-Garciaparra were better
I was gonna say... that certainly settles #1
I was gonna suggest low solo, low combined. But maybe that’s not wise 
I was gonna wait until they’re all submitted
I was hamming it up for effect
I was honestly expecting “KIRK”
I was hoping for more feedback on my Lock/Love/Hurts (lol 3 verbs) question
I was hoping for more participation but Ill go frick myself I guess
I was hoping my roasting of your girl friends would stir up some more commentary
I was hoping that everybody would post theirs and I would discover new music. This has not thus far lived up to my hopes. 
I was hoping that was a setup for a joke so thanks for letting me down
I was in a volatile mood that year lol
I was in charge of mission planning. It went pretty well, got to make cool maps like this
I was in florida past 2 weeks and we did some heavy drinking. Holy balls I have no idea how we used to just do that back to back nights
I was in Philly 2 weeks ago around Rittenhouse Square (supposedly a wealthy area) and also saw a guy smoking crack. Tuesday at 2 pm, just smoking a crack pipe on a stoop in the middle of the city
I was in the car with Marcus and Shelbie, and he was telling me about a fantasy league with a $350 auction budget. Shelbie heard that and thought that was the buy in, and almost had a heart attack for a moment.
I was including 3YL response
I was inspired by you to bear the hater flag while you’re at dinner
I was just ahead of the curve
I was just reading Ben Simmons complaining about the rule, and NCAA Head Mark Emmett basically telling him "hey fuck you it's the NBAs rule not ours" which is true.
I was just so proud to be an American (especially on a day like today) that I felt compelled to share
I was just thinking how amazing Wirfs was all game then that lol
I was just thinking Its still mind boggling that last year’s Bama team had Ruggs, Jeudy, Smith, and Waddle
I was just thinking that the sox commentators don't have the thick Boston accents, then I immediately hear that Bogaerts has had "an amazing staht to the season"
I was just trying to watch my favorite 2019 MNF halftime shows which featured a musical performance / sedan crossover
I was kidding. Obviously can’t predict injuries
I was literally gonna go to a game in San Antonio this weekend
I was literally just thinking ooh joes being sassy, must be 2 ciders deep
I was livid when the Foul Cunts blew it against the LOLphins last week
i was looking at 113th congress 2013-2015
I was looking at the 2014 CFB championship that Mariota lost to OSU
I was looking for that gif 
I was lost with the Danielle chat until you mentioned she was the one who was relocated to newton for like 2 weeks then I was like OHHHHHH I KNOW DIS BITCH
I was mainly referring to the fact that trans people dominate so much of social political discourse despite being 0.3% of the population, including by Republicans. Maybe it’s you who interpreted it as trans hate 🤔 
I was mistaken 
I was more of a command and conquer guy
I was mostly happy with BC's grading of my papers. Only exception was Latin America in the World, where we were supposed to compare two viewpoints and pick a side. I was graded poorly for spending too much time argument my POV and not enough time rehashing what the two historians thought
I was not involved in the Katelynn NYE fiasco 
I was off by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude 
I was on #TeamSmith from the beginning
I was out of hints
I was picking either Julio or Green haha
I was planning on getting one in Thailand but I ran out of cash
I was pretty much the president of RHA according to all my interviews 
I was proud of that one lol
I was racking my brain thinking who could possibly be Chan and goodys friend, but nobody else’s 
I was reading wsb this morning, there was a thread about oil, and it’s amazing how these alpha trading geniuses are also fossil fuels geniuses and international relations geniuses
I was referring to Amy McGrath in KY
I was referring to me noticing the 4 dudes all being Jewish 
I was referring to the $50 on the 2018 giants under 6.5 wins, spawning from the discussion about Barkley being a good pick at 2
i was referring to the latter
I was regularly picked in the top 10 in 3rd grade kickball 
I was responding to Kevin 
I was right about this tho
I was serving at a food shelter all morning
I was shocked by the intensity, duration, and SHEER VIOLENCE
I was surprised by inslee since he’s like not even top 10 in name recognition 
I was surprised how hard mariota fell off
I was surprised too but that's probably the right pick for a big man. AD was out, Ibaka sucked all year, most of the other bigs are offensive minded. Whiteside is probably the second best
I was t paying attention at all but I guess last round all the remaining members of the alliance turned against the patriots right before the final round. Some good memes in the comments haha
I was talking about Mike butthole lapointe
I was talking about OBJ 
I was talking more about the cost sharing idea of insurance, Like “one of us is going to get sick so let’s split the cost”. With auto insurance, you can only get in “it’s not my fault” accidents so many times before it’s kinda your fault 
I was talking to Joe
I was technically billable until my promotion, but I never once billed >8 hours a day. It’s actually illegal for you to do that and also illegal for them to tell you to do that
I was thinking <3 years
I was thinking about that but i don’t think it’s enough time for me. it’d be like 2 weeks of searching, then I’m out within 6 weeks
I was thinking about the riddles. The hat color execution one, if one person messed up, everybody would be killed until the next person messed up... with the lightbulb one, the 100 prisoners throws you off. If it had been say 5 prisoners, it makes you think differently
I was thinking about this Sunday. Has targeting RBs and check downs to the flat (2 separate things) always been so prevalent?
I was thinking left and right wing nut jobs and gravely overlooked the intersection of that vent diagram
I was thinking that, and MJ game 6 although I don’t actually remember seeing that one
I was thinking the offensive player bet doesn’t really involve him
I was thinking, they're gonna need to modify the battle mode so that you don't have to go to a gym to battle. I think the Pokemon catching novelty will wear off if you can't use actually use your Pokemon to battle. Maybe implement a PvP system or an Arena mode, both of which could easily be freemium/micropay. 
I was thrilled that I posted all my season long and SB bets in here and then went 45% ROI
I was told over the phone not to come back in tomorrow
I was told Romney and Ted Cruz are the identical
I was trying to save him for next season
I was trying to think of other people I got into fistfights with
I was trying to think of team carrying players
i was under the impression they act in their natural behavior except theyre trying to kill you
I was up 2 weekends in 3 weeks and got zero responses 🙃
I was very confused about how the actress who played girlfriend came back as the step sister like 4 episodes later
I was very confused as to when i nominated AIDS, but i remembered it was in response to one of you assholes nominating Magic Johnson 
I was waiting for somebody to make that hack joke so I could call them a loser. Bock Boi comes through again
I was waiting for that Jeff 
I was wondering because I saw a FSU  sack last night that basically did that, but the hiding was clearly on accident. 
I was wondering if you hated it just like red delicious apples and the red line. I assume your hatred of basketball comes from a dislike of red auerbach 
I was wondering that lol
i was wrong, my b
I was/am in favor of the playoff though
I wasn’t “upset” I was just trying to enjoy the show!
I wasn’t aware of the add deadline
I wasn’t clear. I meant treat it as if there was no spread
I wasn’t clear. The Big Lie is that Palestine will defeat Israel and reclaim the land from the river to the sea.
I wasn’t invited
I wasn’t planning on accounting for the NE or ME individual districts
I wasn’t sure until that last becker comment but now I’m sure
I wasn't pitying myself. I was apologizing to the man
I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about Anthony Goodwin, godsend to mankind, basically perfect when you really think about it 
I wasn't thinking as much about that, more just natural borders to culture and exchange of money
I watch redzone so none of the CBS cuts 
I watched 9 people die today 
I watched an episode of Bobs Burgers yesterday that included Gail repeatedly lying to her parents about how her life is going better than it is, and it reminded me of China during this crisis
I watched dune 1 on Sunday on a plane. It was good 
I watched for 20 mins and turned it off. But Biden needs to fucking step aside and not run. He is just too old and everybody knows it.
I watched it on Univision a few weeks ago. It was hilarious 
I watched kids shows but not with my family
I watched like 5 episodes this season but I've read every Bachelor Recap on SB Nation. They're hilarious
I watched like 5 of the Harry Potter movies so same thing really
I watched one magic trick and now IG thinks I’m the biggest fucking magic fan in the world 
I watched that video you posted. Pretty cool
I watched that when I had COVID. It was very good
I watched today for literally the first time in months. He's the guy who looks like he's dressed s Albert Einstein for Halloween right?
I watched up until half. Those last 2 BC possessions (botched handoff fumble and pick 6) were disgusting but I still thought we were gonna dominate the second half. Wrong 
I watched Wednesday S2 on the plane a few days ago. That shit was terrible 
I went 1/9. Which did you get that wasn’t bug/grass
I went 4 1 seeds
I went on a tinder date last week. Made me want to un-download the app. Dumbest bitch in America. 
i went to a protest in battery park one year just to check it out, it was kinda boring ngl
I went to the gym at NUI Galway this morning and had to convert kilograms to pounds so it was a mental sweat too
I went to the trinity site this year. It was a bunch of rocks. Would not recommend. 
I went to those ed Sheehan bars too. They’re attractions now
I went with backyard sports style of play both O and D
I went with Emyr because he says nothing but is a big presence and loved by everyone 
I wholeheartedly disagree. Those people, while sick and twisted, exist to pleasure themselves. Mass murderers, especially organized groups, exist only to inflict death upon the world. 
I will accept the eventual robot umpires
I will admit I laughed out loud the first time I read "adjust nomars batting gloves and fuck your mother" 
I will admit though that Fat Jewish and Fuck Jerry are great convo topics with girls
"I will almost surely be around 
( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼"
I will also not spy on behalf of Iran 
I will always blame him for ruining Andrew Lucks career
I will be at the football game 
I will be back here between 26 June until I leave, which could be as soon as 7 July. Not a long time unfortunately 
I will be competitive with you in steals
I will be down
I will be in NYC 9/9 weekend
I will be making $112,644 starting 7 Mar 23
I will be positive after my $450 win last week
I will be second in steals
I will be strongly considering the DC area for my next assignment in late 2022
I will be using this for the rest of my life
I will be very bored today. Please entertain me 
I will be watching
I will be with a drone pilot so try not to call him a baby killer 
I will be! What are ya doing?
I will become the zodiac killer and skin all of you one by one and video tape it and send it to your parents before I support Donald trump 
I will caveat tho that IDF was a lot more willing to strike Hamas targets in civilian buildings than I expected, most famously that 12-story media building which they claim had several Hamas offices. I do believe they did this to be a show of force and willingness to strike as much if not more so than to actually target the Hamas offices. 
I will consider. Especially if I have Monday off
I will die on the no DH hill 
I will END you
I will forever hold a (small) place in my heart for Mets fans 
I will have a car. Need to find a place with parking clearly
I will illustrate in gifs 
I will laugh if it ends up that herd immunity was truly the best way to go
I will link 1 sec
I will make a trip for this
I will make that decision soon. Depends on a number of factors 
I will make the bet
I will never ever forget “DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY KETCHUP?” sent to the entire office
I will never not heart this
I will never not laugh at this
I will never take this man seriously again.
I will not be attending
I will not be taking anything out of the 401k
I will not bend the knee to Marcus the Unworthy 
I will now post that picture every time the JLaw gif is posted
I will orchestrate their slaughtering, not pull the trigger. Hands clean. 
I will pause it
I will probably vote for desantis
I will read all rundowns. But I’m most interested in the Dad perspective 
I will read all that later. Does anyone wanna hang out tonight , totally low key 
I will return with thots
I will say I didn’t spend any time in the Bronx, so it’s possible that there are true Yankees fans hiding there somewhere
I will say it’s shitty that the people in this caravan are marks in a political game that doesn’t actually give a shit about them
I will say losing Bud Dupree and Devin Bush really hurt their defense, even though Bush injury happened before that convo 
I will say sometimes 538s methodologies seem fishy to me. For example they did an article recently that asked NFL fans for their 3 favorite teams as part of a fandom study. Everybody knows real fans have only 1 team. 
I will say that the Syrian people (not necessarily the US) would be better off if the US was deeply involved. 
I will say that they made two rule changes to hockey (in the late 90s I think) to increase scoring and it absolutely worked without adversely changing the game. All they did was eliminate the 2 line pass rule and make offensive zones larger.
I will say this current pentagon job actually isn’t far from management consulting a lot of the time. Where we write largely pointless papers and make PowerPoints that go through a million levels of review to go up to a senior leader who’s already made up his mind and just wants some material to support his decision 
I will take amazing care of a child as long as he is a little league Allstar
I will take it
I will take the blame/credit for the sexist stethoscope boiz trope
I will think about this for the rest of my life
I will wait until all have confirmed they’ve listened, with one exception
I wish @jordanbot posted less political commentary and more hilarious puns
I wish Benny snell became a bellcow
I wish I could hype anything the way Dominicans hype everything 
I wish I could relive the Danielle Brazil moment
I wish I didn’t know who this is. How does anybody like him?
I wish I got off on anything like goody gets off on people doubting the pats. 
I wish I had the conviction to stand by anything like Marcus stands by the FLB take
I wish I hated anyone as much as Jeff hates Isaiah Wynn
I wish I loved anything the way Becker loves snooping on his friends locations
I wish I said white men need to die. Prob wouldn’t have been fired for that
I wish I wanted anything like Marcus wants Becker in the league, or like becker wants to be in a hypothetical groupme he’s not included in
I wish in that instance. Miles Sanders was staring me in the face and I took so much Edmonds and CEH 😢 (and also a lot of sanders)
I wish Rubio was more moderate actually, but he has to come across much more hard right (or at the very least not go a step further left) in order to appeal to those who are voting for Cruz and Trump
I wish that was a joke 
I wish there was more nationwide standardized evaluation other than the SAT, but that idea seems to be very unpopular 
I wish you were both right 
I wish you were my parents growing up lol
I wish. My boss is a female reservist who is a terrible analyst and even worse leader. The whole shop’s happier with her gone. And tbh I think my squadron commander is too. 
I wish. What a tweet
I woke up feeling the cheesiest coach has somehow escaped my wrath 
I won a bet with @Mac America Great Again over this lol
I won’t be attending charleston
I won’t be there for the wedding or Bach party but I will be in Boston in mid June, so hopefully I can see you all then and also stay at somebody’s place 
I wonder how bad Niantic regrets shoving off all the third party developers 
I wonder how big of a factor student debt is in that category
I wonder how it might have changed if the higher seeds could pick their opponents
I wonder how Luke Kuechly would do
I wonder how many 4th and short plays Andy Reid has in his pocket. 30?
I wonder how MMA fighters, boxers, etc would respond if you asked them if they would do away with weight cutting if there's a foolproof way
I wonder how much of that is Browns fans saying they hate the Browns
I wonder how much the Dems low turnout was due to genuine dislike of Hillary Clinton
I wonder how other clubhouses will treat Astros players if they move teams
I wonder how soccer players feel about PKs deciding games. It’s absurd to me that it’s a completely different game
I wonder how that compares to spin rate deltas of other pitches too
I wonder how the Ners would be different if we had signed Kirk instead of trading for Jimmy G
I wonder if a bunch more players are gonna opt out now
I wonder if black Brits are Royal family stans 🤔 
I wonder if hospitals are gonna push to do more outpatient stuff in the next few years to increase profits and recover financially
I wonder if mad Brady has the same effect on his new team 
I wonder if Mexican Americans still think of themselves that way, vs just “Mexican”
I wonder if the frequency of attacks will go down after Ramadan ends
I wonder if the rest of the NFL fandom roots against zesty Caleb like we do
I wonder if the teams who drafted Locker Gabbert and Ponder are historically bad franchises...
I wonder if the Texans slightly regret giving $72MM to Osweiler
I wonder if there is any universe in which the US remained in Iraq for another 10-15 years and helped Iraq implement an effective government
I wonder if there's a gender gap on this topic 
I wonder if they’re gonna keep running play action flood concepts every play with Stafford
I wonder if this means our initial attempts to reach out to the clear upgrades went very poorly
I wonder if you'll ever be able to train your Pokemon by batting, or by any other method besides candies
I wonder to what extent the Bernie/AOC movement provided an effective foil for the Dems = socialist campaign
I wonder to what extent the Bernie/AOC movement provided an effective foil for the Dems = socialist campaign
I wonder what % of America could correctly identify Syria on a blank world map
I wonder what she would say happened to him
I wonder what the American accent sexiness power rankings are to different parts of the world
I wonder what the breakdown is of a movies expenses, like actor salaries, effects, digital work, etc.
I wonder what the delta is in Manhattans population between working and non-working hours 
I wonder what they would say if I sent them that pic lmao
I wonder when the Indians are gonna start going full American names
I wonder who that decision came from. My bet is trump himself. 
I wondered the same lol. But he bet 40 pounds on a 20 leg parlay to win 2200. He was 19/20...
I won't say fuck your mother because she's a saint. But you go fuck yourself 
I wore a tank top and gym shorts yesterday lol
I wore my 48 hours shirt to the gym and he said go BC
I work in Jersey City now and it's clearly trying to be the next Hoboken. Developments are going in like crazy and prices are already high. 
I worry something like Single Payer would hurt the country more than Trumps tweet storms
I would 100% say yes. 
I would accept an apology
I would accept that
I would accept the Jags. I’m a Lawrence believer.
I would agree
I would ask Liz T
I would bang both
I would be a customer though too. I have anti fashion sense
I would be curious to see how and how much your day to day life is affected by being in literally the most liberal place in the world
I would be curious to see the cash flows of the two. Guessing that F1 viewership is way lower, and money comes in larger sums from fewer parties
I would be highly skeptical of any simplistic explanations and arguments about this situation. It’s one of the most complex questions in modern international politics
i would be if i pulled the trigger
I would be impressed if anybody even survived to week 8 lol
I would be interested but I'm going to be back home 
I would be interested in a FH movie club. Let’s not pretend we’re cut out for a book club. 
I would be madder if Jed "Hey I Was Captain of my HS Baseball Team so I'm Gonna Make A Great Owner" York didn't already fire the entire coaching staff and lose the entire team
I would be more inclined to believe it if he didn’t have a history of being the biggest clown show in NFL history
I would be okay with 7-6 every year
I would be surprised if the increase in luxury box revenue surpasses the loss in 26,000 normal tickets per game
I would be very interested to see IBM Watson take a shot at optimizing a person's tax plan by scrubbing the tax code, given a certain situation. 
I would be very interested to see large data on where this $1200 goes
I would beat all the Hotel combined in golf
I would BengLOLs but man it just feels sad
I would bet against it. Boogie gets a worse than deserved rep for being a head case, but it's not all made up. My money says Spurs don't want him and are more likely to keep Aldridge 
I would cite his unit for fraud waste and abuse but he didn’t know what unit he was in
I would classify that that an extreme location
I would concede that if you were actually applying to grad school
I would do a buy out
I would do it but Bad Sports Fan is already my chirp
I would do well on an immaculate grid of the 1998-2000 Yankees (minus the revolving door in LF)
I would expect Google Trends to include things like tweets and Facebook posts, etc. Also curious to see that over a 4 year period 
I would fail this so bad
I would forgive everyone if the Beatdown in Beantown was held in place of the Fuckhole Open
I would have more sympathy for Lamar if the ravens had a rep like the Texans or Colts. For all I know they’re a really solid organization and players love them. 
I would honestly rather watch the pro bowl teams play soccer or basketball or some other sport just for fun
I would just need the other tribe to also have unathletic fatsos
I would like @2021 BC Football (6-6-1 NC) to continue asking groupme history questions 
I would like a .5-1 points per >5 yard gain if that was possible 
I would like to see how effective it is without the false starts and offsides.
I would like to see Jeff perform unwritten
I would like to take a moment to remind you all that Tristan Thompson makes 82MM/5 years 
I would like to wake up tomorrow to a story of everybody’s worst roommates 
I would literally rather talk league of legends
I would love a game where we all have a budget and make an NFL starting roster with different salaries
I would love for Alamogordo to have a Trader Joe’s or a Whole Foods but lmao that’s never gonna happen
I would love for GA to split with Walker and Abrams losing. It would mean candidate quality still matters at least a bit
I would love for the 18th hole crowd swarm to be a thing for all majors going forward 
I would love to have a generals quarters 
I would love to hear what York pitches to his prospects. "Hey I know we've fired our head coach after one season for the past 3 years straight, 2 for poor performance and 1 for personality disputes with me, but lemme tell you about the Niners history as a franchise."
i would love to know the stories of how each of yall know the Wu, Anesto, and Bill Coughlin
I would love to see a video of Anestos thoughts on it 
I would love to see Bill try do what the Ravens did with Lamar jackson 
I would love to tell you that. However the truth is that I'm back to the grind of doing everything, and literally zero things were accomplished by my boss when I was on vacation. He actually was wfh yesterday and when I called him, he said "oh I thought you were coming back tomorrow", indicating that he clearly wfh'd all week I was gone /rant
I would make them do a wall sit until it reflaccidized
I would need to research it, but I’m pretty sure the reason for tuition costs skyrocketing is non-academic faculty 
I would not be surprised if this kid ends up being a right wing nut job who has been corrupted into a pro-Russian stance by Fox News, et Al 
I would pay to have seen this 
I would pay to watch a debate between Becker and a co-resident long-Covid believer
I would rather be a BC fan than a Nebraska fan
I would rather go to war with Russia than the swifties or the beyhive 
I would rather have a double with the bases loaded than a solo home run. Why are home runs so much more valuable?!?!
I would read it if you wrote it...
I would say “at least avatar wasn’t a reboot” but it’s literally Pocahontas except replace redskins with football team 
I would say Arab counts, Middle eastern doesn’t
I would say girls sports but... Thanks Obama
I would say hurts too but I’m a bit more concerned about how his athleticism and rushing ability holds up 
I would say I’m much better in a skins game 
I would say it was an accident, but I don’t need to clap back against a team-less hater
I would say that Becker fell from #1 to #2 after accepting his Tennis Ball of Justice, but launched back to #1 through his combination of post-TBoJ shit talking and unapologetic stealing of Reddit jokes
I would still want to see it
I would support a FH IG group
I would take all these guys as WR2 over thielen lol
I would take Chapman deep 450 left center
I would take significant solace in the defectors getting screwed over
I would take the fuck out of HGH
I would take the WRs in Round 1 bet with you @Jamie Bourque 
I would tend to agree with you there actually. It just sucks that everything - even the purest charitable actions - are held up by avoiding legal ramifications
I would throw a headlock over the falls
I would totally get a full sleeve on my left arm if I could get rid of it when I'm 30.
I would totally go skiing 
I would totally go to that concert
I would totally lay pipe on both 
I would totally threesome her and AOC tho
I would totally watch a reality tv show of him Kershaw and Bumgarner 
I would totes be down for grilling on the roof
I would tune in
I would very much like to look like that
I would volunteer personally do it to those two actually
I would want Diggs for 2 years if I was the pats. Personality risk accepted, cut him after 1 if it’s that bad
I would. The only arena BC Pats fans were in was the massive circlejerk that they created and maintained
"I would’ve LOVED to be there for that. 

PS what on gods green earth compelled y’all to make Becker the QB lmfao"
I would’ve preferred four OTs to four TOS
I wouldn’t be surprised if players get better at working out after retiring. Especially linemen
I wouldn’t be surprised to see significant kinetic action if not full scale war between Iran and Israel in the next couple years. 
I wouldn’t bet on that that’s for sure
I wouldn’t call the ability to buy soda “consumerism”
I wouldn’t demand payment if it wasn’t ironed out ahead of time. Becker you yourself said I “run a tight ship” and you appreciate it
I wouldn’t give any playoff matchup  heavier than 3/1
I wouldn’t hate if y’all wanted to watch a game at Asgard and I could wait on your table
I wouldn’t know goodwin 
I wouldn’t pay, and I’d get an email from him in writing that says he is the reason for the issue
I wouldn’t pick me. I’m 160 and never put on a helmet/pads in my life
I wouldn’t say anything, just agree with her. Calling him out doesn’t really gain you anything
I wouldn’t wanna get beat again either
I wouldn't be surprised if it was fake news
I wouldn't elect a 12 year old and say "let's at least give him a chance to fuck up"
I wouldn't hate that
I wouldn't have said anything
I wouldn't mind if we both lost...
I wrestled 125 and I was probably 140-145 first year at BC
I wrestled at 125 as a senior lol
I wrote an 8 pager junior year of high school for non AP US History that was so lazy and bad that my teacher rejected it and said write something 2 pages that you actually put effort into 
I wrote an 8 pager overnight freshman year for honors. That's it.
I zoomed in on the shoe and then when I zoomed out it was pink
I, for one, always include “This is JK” whenever I text someone
I, for one, couldn’t be more for it
I, for one, have loved Michigan ever since:
I.e. another player on the team will be the kicker while also playing another position 
I.e. If they played again next week, I'd pick the Pats to win
I.e. it didn’t factor into Irans calculus, but they’ll take the coincidence
I.e. just pick the team you think will win and ignore the -3.5 altogether, because trying to calculate if a team will won by 1 vs 3 vs 4+ is a fools errand
I.e. sometimes you unzipped your fly and put your wiener though your boxer fly and pants fly to pee; other times you unbuttoned your pants and pulled down your underwear elastic to pee "over the fence"
I.e. what’s worth doing/skipping, if you’d use X company again. Thanks in advance 🇺🇸
I’d agree Jeff. It’s near impossible for a non p5 to get in now
I’d agree with both of those points
I’d agree. Biggest thing since Harry Potter. 
I’d also bet Goody. And now I’d especially bet Goody
I’d argue Eminem is more of a cultural icon than Drake 
I’d argue this year is an anomaly
I’d assume med school offers you insurance too. Pretty sure BC did
I’d assume not. Same topic as we’re talking now, If they can get their guy, they take him. If not they’ll have a contingency plan
I’d assume residency offers you insurance
I’d assume the Brady MVP odds has already baked in the odds of winning the super bowl
I’d assume they pay more for a rectal patient than an elbow patient
I’d be down tonight. Tomorrow is the BC game tho 
I’d be interested but I got work sorry
I’d be interested in KD take
I’d be interested to see the net worth curves of college graduates by job type
I’d be surprised and impressed if you find a significantly significant negative correlation between QB cap hit and defensive 
I’d be up for Boga borg or racing on Friday night
I’d bet after a decade he wouldn’t. It’s wild to say that the owner of a fucking franchise had to grow up but that’s the truth
I’d bet on Joe 
I’d bet on myself for sure. 5 hours?? That’s so much time 
I’d buy the panthers 
I’d cripwalk the fuck out of that fish head 
I’d even be interested in seeing defensive payroll and defensive efficiency 
I’d expect that’s true for pretty much any job. It’s certainly true for college admissions, which no joke people start preparing for in like 7th grade. 
I’d fumble 
I’d go with LouisvLOL
I’d google examples of med school resumes. My guess is that it will be 90
I’d have to come back and try again next class they have it. Then if I fail again my deployment would be in jeopardy...
I’d have to imagine Israel is gonna hit back and hit back hard. The intent being a combo of 1) demonstrate their military capability to hit them in the critical COGs, 2) punish Iran for the missiles, and 3) get Iran to back down
I’d imagine it depends on how bad it gets. In terms of probability: Electronic and cyber warfare, followed by missile defense, followed by stand off munitions and air interdiction. If we’re sending a ground force invasion then shit has gone haywire. 
I’d include it, to represent the commitment you have to helping patient, even when the patient doesn’t seem to want to help himself
I’d like to bestow this years FH Raised from the Dead Award to Kevin’s post count
"I’d like to formally propose a change to our keeper system:

% increase in salary y/y, starting at 20%, then 25%, then 30%. 3year max"
I’d like to imagine at least half of nicks posts here were the choking convo
I’d like to know Erins thoughts 
I’d like to see Marcus vs Joe
I’d like to see that side by side with the unadjusted 
I’d like to suggest not going to MGM and picking an alternative activity instead
I’d like to think brooks is thinking all about how much he misses this kind of atmosphere and competition 
I’d like to think he was Chinese or Indian 
I’d like to think Marcus would let me babysit Jameson so that could make me 2-0 vs Reposa
I’d like to use halftime to bring attention to Elon Butthole Musk, now claiming that Chess is too simple for a genius like him
I’d listen to this guy 
I’d love a compilation of all our worst football takes in here
I’d love to hear a flat earther theory on solar eclipses
I’d love to hear him chime in himself but B school or something
I’d love to see a keepers in hindsight analysis. I goofed with DHenry, Fournette unfortunately got hurt, Luck can’t be a good value... Thielen and Adams probably best values so far
I’d make sure to include  buzzwords that are in the job description 
I’d participate 
I’d pick Marcus darrow and the bourques
I’d prob put Tyreek at #5 WR
I’d probably take Anesto
I’d put onix and steelix at DE. Charizard at safety. Rhydon at OLB. Aerodactyl at WR
I’d put the O/U at 2.5
I’d rather drive 5 hours than spend 5 minutes in port authority 
I’d rather have cousins than smith
I’d rather have darnold than teddy
I’d rather piss away money than be mistaken for an untouchable
I’d rather work for Accenture for a year
I’d read it
I’d remove Jamie
I’d say $40-50 is about right. I agree $20 won’t get anything more than a gag gift 
I’d say >50% chance it’s a dog
I’d say Alex Li, Alex Sarabia, Taylor Stockton, Eddie Parisi kinda. That’s about it
"I’d say at different points in my hating career:
Puig 
Brock Lesnar
Jon Jones
Richard Sherman 
Lebron
Chris Paul"
I’d say basketball is most likely if they happened to be a nasty shooter
I’d say by June/July is a decent guesstimate 
I’d say generally no. But when there hasn’t been a single star, or even serviceable QB, it starts to play a factor for me
I’d say he’s around QB25
I’d say it does (not an oriental but I’ll allow it) but my opinion only counts half as much as Chan’s 
I’d say Jeff is cabbage guy
I’d say Marcus is a king E tier
I’d say most good golfers inflate their handicap, and most bad golfers deflate it
"I’d say myself for NFL since 2014
Goody for anything before
Jeff for anything Patriots"
I’d say once every 2-3 months is about accurate 
I’d say so. I think if they could go back, they wouldn’t do it again
I’d say the craziest Iran would do would be to launch missiles at US bases in Iraq. I don’t know what the US missile defense capabilities are at those bases, but it would be very very bad. But nobody knows what the level of retaliation would be. 
I’d say you’re without doubt, at least as informed as the average voter. This isn’t a test, just want to hear your ranks
I’d share a photo but i didn’t take one since my phone was in a dry bag. Other people took them
I’d still rather be on your side. Call it 75/25 right now. 
I’d take -4. $20?
I’d take Hopkins over Seth Rollins 
I’d take the tool kit and the canteen
I’d take the under 
I’d think you of all people could recognize a fix when you see it
I’d throw it about 50
I’d trust John Thompson over Matthew berry
I’d wager it’s an extremely low false positive rate
I’ll add it to the offense list. With the exception that if you put commas in your kids name, that’s also Gulag-able
I’ll admit taylor has not yet become the bellcow I was hoping him to be, but I still think there’s a chance
I’ll be around from Thursday through Monday to move in my brother into Berkelee 
I’ll be around in June. I’ll buy her a drink but I won’t be wearing my OCPs unless it turns her on
I’ll be ok unless the plane crashes
I’ll be on call in case they need perfect protection 
I’ll bet you $50 no owner sells this season 
I’ll bite. You can hurt other people using some illegal drugs. Gambling you can only hurt yourself
I’ll bring a bat and softballs so we can do a HR derby right after
I’ll die
I’ll do it during an intermission of the Beatdown in Beantown
I’ll do it. It’s cake, just email me a screenshot of your map
I’ll double check
I’ll even let you set my lineup
I’ll get cracking as soon as my order of Nugenix comes in
I’ll give #2 to Tyreek Hill
I’ll give becker 50-1 that Jameis doesn’t finish top 10 ROS
I’ll give it a maybe on psychological effect. I don’t think a half yard matters from outside the 5 yard line, except on first downs of course. 
I’ll give you 10000:1 for $20
I’ll go halvsies on that with you 
I’ll help you follow through if necessary 
I’ll learn to cut my own hair before I pay $50 for a fucking haircut 
I’ll let you know if he’s on the DC Defenders or the Arlington Renegades
I’ll let you know when I go to the San Antonio Commanders vs. Birmingham Iron game on Sunday 
I’ll let you know when I move there 
I’ll make a spreadsheet, Goody will have to input on the site 
I’ll match whatever becker does for the side bet
I’ll meet you in the middle: invade and annex Mexico. Boom. No more illegals.
I’ll never forget Alex Smith going from #1 overall megabust to very good as soon as we switched from singletary to harbaugh 
I’ll never forget that Zappe game
I’ll never forget the Vox mea culpa on that prop
I’ll never forget when Connor and I showed up to your house for the draft and I brought a 12 of beer, he brought a 12 of cider, and all the ciders were gone first
I’ll never forget when the SF Pride parade banned drag queens because they might offend trans people 
I’ll never forget when we hit all our ESMA regulation deadlines in 2017 and some PMD held an all call and said “you all saved the firm 50 million dollars” and everybody cheered, and I was thinking “do y’all actually give a fuck?!”
I’ll pass. That’s odds of the Dems taking the senate at all, let alone the other 2 
I’ll play if you get 9 and need a 10th
I’ll put $50 on not making 80
I’ll put it on the “to watch upon return” list, after Severance S2
I’ll stick to jeopardy 
I’ll still don’t get why the jets traded Elijah Moore for peanuts
I’ll still take Biden at 5:1 for $20
I’ll take 1000-1 on impeachment tho
I’ll take 8 to 1 that he’s single
I’ll take becker -600 
I’ll take Biden at 6:1 for $20
I’ll take bills over 8.5
I’ll take Darrel Williams over 12.5 receiving for $20
I’ll take field -180 
I’ll take Iowa +1
I’ll take it
I’ll take it
I’ll take it
I’ll take it at $50
I’ll take it for $.01
I’ll take Pats
I’ll take that as a compliment since Zuko is the best character, but no way I’m more Zuko than Sokka
I’ll take that as a yes
I’ll take that bet
I’ll take that bet
I’ll take that bet
I’ll take that bet and not require fulfillment of outstanding debts
I’ll take that bet joe
I’ll take the layup lmao
I’ll take the other side of this bet
I’ll take the Texans under 
I’ll take the UGA over OSU bet lol
I’ll take the under Kevin
I’ll take this her
I’ll take what we can get 
I’ll think of that when I’m pushing pencils in the supply chain
I’ll trade you Davante Adams for the download key
I’ll trade you Jonathan Taylor for Davante 
I’ll try it out
I’ll wave to you from at the Odenton stop
I’ll wear my service dress in anticipation of the funeral
I’m #crine again
I’m 165 pounds and ranked above Jamie but I’ll take it 💪🏼
I’m a big “the modern guys are clearly better” subscriber. So easy replacements of the 2 olds for KD and Steph. Otherwise don’t have the total list tbh
I’m a big Ali Roth fan
I’m a big fan of “if your team is playing X team, which player would you most want them to not have”
I’m a big soccer guy so you can trust me
I’m a big waffle guy 
I’m a broken record but I cannot get over how fucking funny the blue check shit is
I’m a fan of dominoes
I’m a good skier 
I’m a Josh Dobbs Stan, not a Josh giddey Stan 
I’m a little worried when I make a joke like this and Kevin likes it
I’m a lot of things, but not a liar
I’m a registered D. CA voter so it matters more
I’m a US MARINE. Buy my clubs because I’m a MARINE
I’m about as good as Fidel with my left hand
I’m about halfway through the new 30 for 30 on Lance Armstrong and it is really really good
I’m absolutely down with a devils threesome, but a devils foursome?? Probably out on that tbh
I’m actually a bit worried since I haven’t played in a month 
I’m actually considering going to a coach, it’s really pissing me off
I’m actually curious about this. I’ve also never hit with a wooden bat
I’m actually mad
I’m actually not sure what Becker’s point is. Is it “non SEC teams are always frauds because they don’t experience the grind of an SEC schedule”?
I’m actually surprised more pitchers don’t do what Cueto does and change their timing, even just occasionally 
I’m against crime, and I’m not afraid to admit it
I’m all about the captions baby
I’m all ears (eyes?) if you’re in a typing mood
I’m all in on the Mets baby
I’m almost done with all available hardcore history episodes, got all of serial season 1 downloaded, plus 538 politics 
I’m also down for racing and it doesn’t have to include everyone
I’m also flying Friday 8/30 but should be good to go by mid afternoon ET
I’m also for no age limit. But that still doesn’t answer the question of allowing college players to earn money off their own likeness without fundamentally changing college sports. All these suggestions are basically circumventing the actual question, which there is clearly no easy answer to
I’m also gonna get on a powerlifting plan. So if anybody knows any I’ll take recs 
I’m also gonna try an admin job at MIT or Harvard but if not that I’ll prob go be a barback
I’m also not going and have no stake in this fwiw
I’m also not sure if I can do that 
I’m an idiot there’s literally a description on the left
I’m anti kavanaugh. I think at best, he’s a liar about his drinking under oath. But to think one party would behave more “morally” than another at this point is antifactual
I’m asking because I went grocery shopping today and didn’t wear a mask for the first time in 15 months, and it felt weird
I’m assuming in that scenario, playing for the “what if we don’t stop them” situation is -EV because you’ll almost certainly lose either way. You just have to stop them.
I’m assuming she’s the lowest positive number. Meaning nobody has better odds than her, but she’s still <50%
I’m assuming the polls on white women going hard left is accurate
I’m assuming y’all are silent because you’re clearing your calendars
I’m at 10 on this list, 11 if you could a teaspoon of oat milk from Johns place. 
I’m at Boston burger company by newbury right now. Burgers look dank
I’m at the lake in the clouds hut on mt Monroe. The naturalist here looks like Drachman and one of the thru hikers looks like darrow
I’m at the point where this guy deserves zero benefit of the doubt
I’m aware of the lateral risk. And Obviously in a 3-4 it wouldn’t work, but in a nickel or other sub it might. And I’m betting the RB can pick up the DL for half a second, which is enough time on a 3 yard drag 
I’m back in San Mateo, gonna miss it unfortunately
I’m bout to head out so i need backup but basically somebody added this former BC acquaintance to groupme who was a, let’s say well-meaning weirdo goober. The decision on whether to kick him out created a schism in the groupme.
I’m bout to log on
I’m boycotting FLB 5. One per year only
I’m brave enough to say it: the military runs on thicc Latina E-3s
I’m bringing my clubs to Boston (June 10-24) so hopefully we can get a weekday round in with the boys 
I’m categorically against booing your own team, but I’m considering making an exception 
I’m coming home next week without an Arabian princess so it’s not always a successful jihad 👳🏽😢
I’m commissioner and I approve this trade 
I’m confused though. Is this the fault of the spineless democrats, the evil republicans, the doomed two party system, or the patriarchy?
I’m confused, isn’t Slime Time the gateway?
I’m confused?
I’m convinced the G line in NYC doesn’t actually exist, but if it did it is the worst line in subway history 
I’m cool with another year. I’m gonna be deployed anyway lol
I’m crine 
I’m curious on how he says it would affect American foreign policy today. He assumes we prevent the russian revolution (hard stretch IMO but let’s go with it), which would keep Russia as a czar-dom perennially? Then what?
I’m curious to know your hypothesis 
I’m curious which bellarmine boiz were there 
I’m down to watch ALL the games
I’m down with the no fly list = no gun thing even if it’s borderline unconstitutional 
I’m down. Text me when you do. Haven’t played since early Covid tho
I’m dumping on Kelvin Benjamin. Let it go for a minute 
I’m en route
I’m excited for this next game. Anybody have action or hot takes?
I’m expecting not, but I ask because I’m wondering how anybody can support it without parroting the trade wars are easy to win BS
I’m extremely curious how this came up
I’m familiar with what palantir is but I’ve never used it. So no thoughts. 
I’m fine with it
I’m fine with people named rob 
I’m following
I’m for citizens united tho. Donating to a private company that does political campaigning/advertising is fine and effective 
I’m forced to root for Correa now. Hopefully he fits in the locker room which has changed a lot since the goofy Pablo and Pence days under Bochy
I’m fortunate that it’s my job to follow these things
I’m getting Israeli paramore ads 
I’m getting sick of SBNation so a new sports site would be welcome
I’m getting weirder out. This stops now. I actually like this girl and if you say one more thing in here I will beat you up next time I see you. 
I’m glad you said that because now I feel less bad about watching that over the BC fame
I’m going directly from Boston to Texas for 2 weeks, not gonna happen
I’m going to say that all the seasons we kept addazio was key in convincing Hafley that we’ll give him more than enough time to build the team he wants. So at the end of the day, keeping the dazzler all this time was worth it 
I’m going to the game 
I’m gonna bring back yadadamean
I’m gonna concede this one. I agree with goody, I’m convinced 
I’m gonna cry laughing if he says “haha fuck you I’m going to the raiders”
I’m gonna cry when Clemson wins the natty and then Ohio state goes undefeated in the spring season and both of them claim titles
I’m gonna get off work earlier than expected 
I’m gonna go Watch the Throne, Sideline Story, and Section 80. I did listen to Rolling Papers a LOT tho. And Take Care was probably the most played
I’m gonna have a stroke 
I’m gonna kill my self 
I’m gonna laugh if you win the bet and Lock has like a 40 QBR
I’m gonna laugh so hard if the Jets pull the Hackett for Rodgers trick and it actually works
I’m gonna laugh when it turns out all-channel TV with ads turns out to be the best option
I’m gonna laugh when OBJ goes off next week and the “he needs Eli on the field” jokes come pouring in
I’m gonna laugh when the lakers lose in the WCF and LA gets their dreams crushed 3 times in one year 
I’m gonna lump that in under the “fuck college sports they’re goy” umbrella
I’m gonna make $36K in the AF, so I’m good lmao
I’m gonna miss <$20 rounds. Probably the only thing I’m gonna miss
I’m gonna put myself as strawberry rhubarb pie. So I can put emphasis on the H every time I say rhubarb
I’m gonna resist so hard after this
I’m gonna say Chvrches - The Bones of What You Believe in. I learned about them around the beginning of the year and they still rock, even though none of you wanted to go to their concert with me
I’m gonna skim so much in OTS
I’m gonna spend $60 on Deanthony Keith 
I’m gonna try go to a Birmingham Iron game in 3 weeks
I’m good at excel and racism 
I’m good I found it
I’m good with goody as a late add. Any objections?
I’m good. I’m still basking in the glory of my ankle breaking crossover. Pretty sure people we’re talking about it on base all day 
I’m halfway through Chans, after going through my own then Marcus’s and joes. Chans list loves the epic ballads. Joes list is certainly unique
I’m hanging out at ass guard
I’m happy that @Boe Jourque is saying “Big XYZ guy”
I’m happy that my claims of shooting par on 9 are believable, which IMO is the same level of claim as never striking out in little league
I’m having a great day y’all. Operation Allies Refuge is complete. 120,000 lives saved.
I’m heading to Waco for Iowa State @ Baylor and I’ve learned my road trip crew also wants to stop at Magnolia farms 
I’m here for a mahomes heel turn
I’m here for ALL the ASMB
I’m here for the golf course conversation
I’m holding you to that
I’m honestly relieved it’s between all democrats because if this was a general, trump and the republicans would be shouting vindication of voter fraud allegations from the top of their lungs. Hopefully the NYC Dems who lose this race don’t do that…
I’m honestly torn. There is no easy debt forgiveness solution, and while it’s both fiscally irresponsible and unfair, I don’t want to screw people who made a dumb financial decision at 18 for their entire lives. So i guess my answer is to limit interest but let them remain unforgiven until some solution comes around that I’m not smart enough to think of. Hey maybe it’s private purchasing of debts for the kids who show potential, or the Australian solution John was talking about. But I cannot in good faith support waving a federal magic wand and poofing away the debt, even though that’s likely to happen
I’m hoping to play in Ireland when I’m there next week
I’m howling
I’m hurt resting right now. I’m down to get dinner at like 7-7:30 then go to Jillian’s 
I’m imagining he has his own business 
I’m in
I’m in
I’m in
I’m in a pickle here, because I do believe basic healthcare is a right, but I also believe a doctor should be able to refuse to treat a patient 🤔 
I’m in accordance with all of those but allegedly it’s used in New England to refer to a Vermonter? I had never heard that
I’m in El Paso. I fly out to Shaw AFB SC at 5 am 
I’m in florida rn so no
I’m in for bowling if Emyr is
I’m in Germany for a few days
I’m in if you bet it
I’m in John
I’m in line for the bus
I’m in on Brissett. Big Ben and rivers are on the tail ends of their careers but not bad. I’d put darnold in there too
I’m in on this
I’m in Portsmouth for like 4 hours. Anybody want to come up and bring me a beer?
I’m in SC @The Big Dick Bandit should I hit up Clemson girl for you?
I’m in the Air Force not the navy 
I’m in the market for a new car
I’m in. Jamie is a no
I’m inclined to agree. I mean who would take Cincy straight up vs Bama
I’m inclined to participate in more events than not. Idk about the night party thing because that might be a weird environment, but other BBQ style events where you run into people, I’m all about that
I’m interested in a BC game, as mentioned a few times. More than that will be tough to swing. An NYC trip or something similar is easily doable tho
I’m interested in the story where John got his dick skinned after taking 4 viagra 
I’m just assuming his full name is Andrew 
I’m just so sick of roasted chicken and vegetables
I’m just trying to think of other candidates
I’m Kevin. I want this job because (mission/location/etc.). I am a good fit because (background, credentials, etc).
I’m leaning towards doing that, as long as my transaction fees aren’t egregious. I have until Dec 31 right?
I’m leaving on good terms. I mean if you wanna get technical, I got fired for inappropriate comments but tomato tomahto
I’m leaving you like Emyr left me
I’m legally prohibited from publicly criticizing him lol 
I’m like 90% sure you were involved in posts about it passing the BAR and providing accurate medical diagnoses
I’m like a 14. Gotta set the expectations for FH mini open
I’m liking that IF I WIN one right now
I’m literally laughing out loud
I’m literally mid coitis and have a decision to make
I’m literally never gonna find out
I’m looking at possibly trying to buy in VA / MD and holy cow
I’m looking forward to the first instance of #ASMB at Jeff
I’m love how I got 3rd (slightly below a quadriplegic hamster) simply by saying “I’m a good skier” one time, whereas Joe has gone like 30 times in the past month and is ranked below me
I’m loving the Twitter war on PFF right now
I’m lowering myself to worse than Joe. If darrow is close, I’ll put myself below him too. Never seen either of them ski
I’m mad that butthole chip Kelly and butthole UCLA appear good
I’m making the keepers sheet
I’m more like Ted Pundy 
I’m more of a Puddy
I’m more surprised that Stafford has looked pretty mediocre because the narrative has been that he would ball
I’m most interested in @#JustFacts✅ list 
I’m moving back to San Mateo next week
I’m no lab coat boi but nuclear fusion has been the white whale for like 40 years, and this is the first news I’ve ever seen that it might actually work
I’m not a demographicizer or a psephosologist so idk how they do it 
I’m not a marvel fan but marvel is hands down the dominant cultural film franchise for the 2010s
I’m not an EPA purist per se but this feels right
I’m not an indistinguishable Mexican/Native American, so Im clearly not from here
I’m not Arab enough yet to have a Kunya
I’m not concluding anything. But I used to dismiss the claim as a conspiracy theory and the more I’ve read, the more I’m open to the possibility there are significant elements of truth
I’m not convinced this isn’t an Onion article...
I’m not disagreeing with you
I’m not gay, but if Darrow came onto me I probably wouldn’t say no
I’m not gonna disclose what i was offered because I’m not a rat like Marcus. But they were more than palatable offers
I’m not gonna go there with @Skimmer in the group
I’m not gonna predict doomsday, but its not a gamble I’m willing to take. It wouldn’t surprise me if it totally upended the world order and global peace that has existed for the past 75 years 
I’m not gonna risk it
I’m not kidding
I’m not mad but my baseline assumption was that everybody had at least heard about it
I’m not one to repeatedly wail that XYZ will tank trump. Corona mishandling is a major sticking point with Trump already. That and there is a tape, and it shows him lying. That’s why I think it will have an effect
I’m not particularly surprised, but the total inconsistency is still shocking 
I’m not playing, just following on the app
I’m not quite sure what we’re arguing anymore but Kirk > Smith, suck my balls
I’m not saying that worst case scenario is definitely happening in either case. More about framing the attitudes around both of them, which I find similar. 
I’m not sure I’ve ever looked into success rate or EPA on middle of the field. If so I don’t remember what it said
I’m not sure if it uses just one season or multi season data to compute the average tho
I’m not sure if they actually believe it or just love the troll
I’m not sure punting there was the right call
I’m not sure that’s the defense you think it is
I’m not sure what “for real” means. If it means super bowl favorite then it’s pretty easy to say a team is not for real
I’m not sure what I’m more excited for: the return of football season or the return of #ASMB
I’m not sure. It looks like the operation is not going as well as the Russians would’ve liked. 
I’m not surprised pats couldn’t get pressure. But Foles was better than I ever expected
I’m not surprised. Most marijuana purchases go up in smoke very quickly
I’m officially a democrat too now lol
I’m ok with that pitch. I like my doctors to be nerds and spent their time in the lab, not on the field
I’m on leave in San Mateo until end of month
I’m on team cubes
I’m on the fence, leaning against because it’s safer not to. But it’s a unique opportunity. Space will be the most strategically important domain in the near future. Plus it never hurts to be an early bird in the next big thing. However it’s very far from the “tip of the spear”, and there’s always the threat of the memes.
I’m on the fence. I feel like it’s overused when we’re just okay friends, and should be reserved for deep friendships no homo
I’m on your side with anti-expansion Becker but this argument that isn’t ludicrous
I’m opposite on both
I’m out
I’m out on steak fries. They’re always too soggy
I’m out on yeet. Getting old sign #6
I’m out. I was just throwing you peanuts anyway
I’m packing all my shit rn and it’s the fucking worst as always so I’m looking to distract myself with the FH
I’m playing golf tomorrow. If I shoot above 85 I might just fucking end it
I’m playing Olympic Club today @#JustFacts✅ so if I break 80 then I’ll indulge
I’m playing today haha
I’m pretty sure I’m on record in here saying Jakobi was better than Juju and I don’t get the Pats opting for the latter
I’m pretty sure they don’t know rolling the window or the floppy disk.
I’m pretty sure they’ll be able to weather the storm lol
I’m pretty sure this is just how the board fell
I’m probably going out Friday night to Sol Azteca near Fenway. All are invited. Anybody been there before?
I’m pulling for Michigan
I’m ready for another river float so we can take shirtless pics
I’m ready for the FH open baby
I’m referring to starting players on bye and injured
I’m rooting for the warriors
I’m sad we didn’t get more chatter on goodwins NBA player comps. That shit was fucking gold. 
I’m saying striking someone out is basically impossible 
I’m selling stuff on Fb marketplace and holy balls the number of scammers is insane
I’m slightly concerned about the lack of hyperbolically awesome news beats about lance 
I’m so disappointed in you guys
I’m so embarrassed. It was almost a great meme 
I’m so excited for all our boys
I’m so glad I pirate every one of these
I’m so happy football is back
I’m so happy the LOL thing has caught on
I’m so interested
I’m so mad the Astros have been good in the playoffs so far
I’m soft set on the NC Dinos, but I could be convinced to join the Kiwoom Heroes or the LG Twins
I’m sorry I only did it once 
I’m sorry Joe that sucks
I’m sorry, it’s “people with retardation” 
I’m sorry. This whole thing has been exhausting 
I’m spending 40 days in the desert being tempted by the thought of being ranked again. It’s what true Jesuit Catholic BC fans should do
I’m sports wacked out. Giants have lost 3 straight and Warriors 2 straight and I threw batting practice yesterday and it didn’t go well
I’m starting to believe Kamala is favored 60-40 or so. And nobody wants to be wrong about trump again so they’re hedging
I’m starting to think you’re a bot created by Matt Levine 🤔 
I’m still crying laughing 
I’m still disgusted by glolants 
I’m still going strong off of the 2010-2014 giants. Literally can’t imagine a Boston sports fan ever needing therapy
I’m still interested in getting 100% participation in this poll question
I’m still mad at Jed York for firing him in 2014
I’m still mostly sure it’s just a schtick but it’s possible he actually thinks we agreed to $5
I’m still shocked Mookie allegedly has higher WAR in 6 years than manny in 8
I’m still skeptical it will happen but I think I’m absolutely for it. I do not know the nitty gritty details. 
I’m still up for a Fuckhole trip to Austin, however limited the Fuckholes are (double entendres)
I’m struggling to think of a worse one
I’m struggling with one for Kevin 
I’m stumped 
I’m super good at standing at attention now. It’s all I do all day
I’m super interested to see if steph is a first of his kind sort of game changer or literally the best shooter of all time 
I’m supposed to trade my kelenna azuibuike autograph with goody but I forgot who I’m getting in return
I’m sure fellow fascist @Joey Brackets agrees
I’m sure I’d have gotten more if you had “extra lives” 
I’m sure of it 
I’m sure the housing and neighborhood will be more than fine, but yeah I think not having a car will be a perpetual annoyance
I’m surprised hurts isn’t higher than mahomes
I’m surprised Sewell didn’t go higher after Wirfs showed how much of a difference maker he can be
I’m surprised we haven’t seen more WRs playing RB like Cordarelle. He was a success on NE. Ty Montgomery was the other one and he was a success too
I’m surprised you didn’t say “Banged @Skimmer so many times to that album”
I’m talking about Lucerne cheddar that’s $2.79 at star market
I’m tempted to bet Nabers to LAC. I know all the buzz is Harbaugh hates WRs and loves OLs, but Occam’s razor says Nabers is a generational WR and LAC needs a WR
I’m thankful for Goody Becker banter. It’s top of the power rankings banter
I’m the dual conductor of that and the “Marcus is bad at golf narrative is false” train
I’m the Rams
I’m thinking fewest exciting players. Raiders might actually take the cake  
I’m thinking if testing becomes super accessible, test and trace could be easy, if it’s cheap enough
I’m torn between group 2 and 3
"I’m torn on whether to call them 
“fat-poors” or “poor-fats”"
I’m trying to induce him to commit
I’m trying to think of more black QBs lol
I’m tryna go there in the next month or so
I’m unlikely tbh, pains me to admit it as a former rich but I’m running out of money
I’m up to 168 🍰
I’m usually not a tin foil hat guy but I think it would actually depend on the team. Chiefs get it? Delay the game. WFT? Play it.  
I’m voting R for governor and AG, and D for House and SoS
I’m waiting for the metrics. Somebody will have WPA odds of 4th and 25 vs punting there 
I’m watching 
I’m watching it’s awesome
I’m watching rough and rowdy so that pretty much demonstrates where my life is right now
I’m watching with non football fans for the first time in years and it’s weird
I’m way worse at immaculate grid than I thought I’d be
I’m willing to be proven wrong. But like I taste tested with 50 people (in like 2004) so I feel like I have legit data with this one
I’m willing to consider the idea of UBI for the same reasons, but it would have to replace the current welfare entitlements, not supplement them.
I’m with becker here. But it’s still so disgusting how low the bar has fallen with trump 
I’m with goody here. I’ve never lived through a period where the country has felt weaker and more divided.
I’m with John here. That is pretty clear 
I’m with marcus here. And the draft capital is worth more than the money. 
I’m with you becker. As a warriors fan, this last championship felt way later than the others
I’m with you on all of those (except PPR). Roster changes depends on league size. 
I’m working but y’all welcome to watch here and I’ll be able to sorta hang
I’m working on it but tryna go somewhere foreign for 1-2 weeks
I’ve also been a big Poirier ever since his fight against Korean Zombie like 6 years ago. One of the best fights I’ve ever seen, he lost, and in his post fight interview, he was both devastated and determined to come back stronger. And I was like “this guy cares so much, and I think he has what it takes to be great” 
I’ve also finished Skranger Things 2. Loved it of course 
I’ve always been a big trans parent guy 🏳️‍⚧️ 
I’ve always said “no such thing as a bandwagon mets fan”
I’ve always said MBAs are the truly impactful degrees
I’ve applied for some admit jobs at Stanford for after I go on a trip
I’ve basically been in the same situation as your brother for the past month. It’s pretty sweet not gonna lie
I’ve been anti keeper forever you know this
I’ve been doing some reading on FFL forums about trading auction $ like our league. The overarching theme is to not do it, because it devolves leagues into anarchy. But the only mitigating factor I’ve found is what becker suggested, to limit the amount of tradable $. None of this future vs present value chicken shit ass bull shit. 25% of $200 was the most often mentioned cap, but I say we limit it at $20. What do y’all say?
I’ve been in that Ross 
I’ve been mccocked many times, but not this time
"I’ve been pissing in the same urinal for every pee every day. I always aim for the same urinal cake, slowly eroding it in and creating a depression in the center, like the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.

Today, the divot became a hole. The bottom of the urinal is visible through the urinal cake. This is the most exciting thing in the 6 weeks of my deployment so far. Morale is at an all time high. 🇺🇸 "
I’ve been planning around the rain as best as I can, but pretty much yeah, because you just sit there in the rain if you don’t move. It’s really not bad while you’re walking because you’re soooo sweaty all the time, but it sucks when you make camp because usually all the people are out hanging out, versus sitting cramped under the shelter. 
I’ve been playing I frequently though
I’ve been thinking about doing some IF posts from the trail but haven’t since I don’t wanna violate ASMB rules
I’ve been to a Texas Roadhouse and an outback one time, and I legit wouldn’t be surprised if the steaks were identical and setting was different
I’ve been trying to recruit people for months now
I’ve been wanting to take BP but becker refuses to pitch to me because he’s scared I’ll hit in in the forehead with a 117 ball speed
I’ve been wondering if the 2018 glasses are going to have the eyehole in the top or bottom of the 8. This answers none of my questions 
I’ve decided HIPAA is stupid and I will die on this hill
I’ve decided I want the Ners to sign Cam Newton
I’ve decided I’m blaming the Latino rightward shift exclusively on the word “Latinx”
I’ve decided to Stan Josh Dobbs
I’ve done 15 best ball drafts and taken zero Zay Flowers (ADP 92). I think I’ve internalized my low opinion of BC football 😢 
I’ve done a -4G pushover over the Mig. And if she asks me how I could get tally, answer is “because I was inverted”
I’ve done it again boys. Thanks to the FH for helping
I’ve done it three times 
I’ve faded him in fantasy every year for the past 4-5 seasons and regretted it every time 
I’ve figured it out guys. Give Palestine control of the whole region, but they have to do a land acknowledgment every time they pray
I’ve found myself reacting against the ideology where I live, probably because I’m more exposed to the idiotic extremes. Like I think NYC made me more conservative whereas the gordo made me more liberal. 
I’ve found that the more you know about a sport, the more the announcers seem to state the obvious 
I’ve had a bad problem slicing my drives and I can’t fucking fix it. Irons still good. Any tippers?
I’ve had dank Buffalo burgers, elk burgers, lamb burgers, there’s tons of burgers
I’ve had impossible meatballs, I think there was one in Cambridge actually. Not a bad effort but absolutely inferior to real meat
I’ve had that video sent to me by like 5 people 
I’ve heard a Green Egg and Horizon Smoker are perfect for brisket and ribs, respectively 
I’ve heard an instant pot is a good investment
I’ve heard good things about it. Is it on Netflix?
I’ve heard madden 20 is awful, unrelated to the Kap fiasco
I’ve heard the gulag practices are brutal. Coach basically works you to death 
I’ve heard y’all say Frankie and Joe are the same person but my word
I’ve heard you extol many restaurants but never a Chinese one
I’ve just been taking mucinex, coldeeze, and Tylenol. Is that right?
I’ve literally never had a massage lol
I’ve literally never rooted for becker harder
I’ve lost $100 bets dozens of times, but that’s my max unit. I think the one that hurt the most was Harbaugh not leaving the Ners in after 2014
I’ve met one Dbacks fan even though they’re the closest team
I’ve moved 8 times since graduating and it’s the worst day of the year every time 
I’ve never actually seen anybody in the middle of shooting up
I’ve never been able to make it through the whole video 
I’ve never been in any situation like that so it’s really tough to say 
I’ve never felt better about my best ball degeneracy
I’ve never felt more confident in a hot take
I’ve never had a crab Rangoon in my life 
I’ve never had prosciutto on a sandwich. It’s a hors doeuvers food
I’ve never had their shakes or freezes or whatever, but their food is absolute garbage
I’ve never hated lock. He’s just the worst quarterback I’ve ever seen and somehow convinced a significant portion of NFL fan base that he’s a solid player. 
I’ve never heard of any of these hoes in my life besides boomers daughter
I’ve never heard of the vogue 
I’ve never looked forward to my bout in the Beatdown in Beantown more than right at this moment
I’ve never met anybody who said they wished they were shorter. The tallest person I know is 6’8
I’ve never met anybody who’s switched and wanted to go back to snek 
I’ve never seen 3 and 8 before
I’ve never seen any of those people in my entire life
I’ve never seen high school musical
I’ve never seen him play but  I’d take hoopkid92 over him
I’ve never seen him smile like this before
I’ve never seen such disrespect for 10 classic franchises
I’ve never skimmed a message faster
I’ve never thought about how absurd and awesome this logo is until now
I’ve never watched an anime besides Pokémon so i think I can confidently avoid this one
I’ve only ever heard Mass people say “Spygate was a hoax”
I’ve only met Marcus’s dad once, but man Marcus is a carbon copy of his dad
I’ve peed in a lot of pools. I don’t anymore but I wouldn’t be disgusted if someone else pees in a pool
I’ve played that course
I’ve read the same, and that the main cause is government failure from the top down to the states and county governments. Should’ve let Walgreens handle logistics.
I’ve read the same, since it creates an anti hero cult of personality around the perpetrator. In a super simple definition, it boils down to people wanting attention and knowing they can get it instantly and majorly in today’s world 
I’ve read yelp is super shitty about basically extorting restaurants to be their customer. Like “pay us or you’ll show up on page 50 of every restaurant search” 
I’ve repeatedly gotten the shaft in this league, that’s all
I’ve said for years, there’s no excuse for Joe to not be better at golf. Glad to see he’s finally stepping up
I’ve said it as nauseous: Leftists hate America, that’s their core belief. Everything stems downstream from that. 
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I love Aaron Rodgers ending his career like this
I’ve seen 10 seconds of true detective, and it’s those 10 seconds
I’ve seen that on social media a lot tho
I’ve sharted twice that I can remember 
I’ve started saying “We got weights in the fish!” alongside any “let’s go!”s
I’ve watched 2 episodes. 1 was ok, 2 was hilarious 
I’ve yet to find anyone who I’d choose Bill Coughlin over
IAF famously does the "soft knock" which is dropping an inert or very small warhead on a building in order to warn civilians to get out, this thing is coming down in 10 minutes
Ian Rappoport tweeted the same
Ibaka to the Raptors for Terrence Ross and a first
Ibrahim “Kobe Bryant” Raisi?
Ichiro 
Ichiro more for the setup but still counts 
ICYMI for the past 3 days the Syrian Civil War has gotten super hot for the first time since ~2018. The Syrian Opposition (who are mostly Sunni terrorists) have had an insane ground force push and captured gigantic areas of the country, including Aleppo and Hama. 
ICYMI: Chernobyl is literally in Ukraine 
I'd actually argue that worldwide, 99%+ of people killed by random attacks on civilians are from Islamic terror groups
I'd allege Rubio and Cruz have the highest rate of actually answering the question asked to them
I'd also get the small "salad" container and just fill it with grilled chicken
I'd assume so. It's flabbergasting
I'd assume the overwhelming majority of their decline is due to that, not viewers choosing a competitor
id balance it out with another div winner at +130
I'd bang all of them except second from right, middle, third from left, and maybe second from left 
I'd be down to play Catan or something
Id be in for that. Def out on the monkey
i'd be surprised if that green portion shifts by more than a few pct points, at least in the next ~6 months or so.  That "wait and see" group will hopefully continue to lessen to ~5% or so.  So I guess 20% is probably about right.
Id bet $20 winner finishes -5 or higher
i'd bet dallas wins the NFC East if anyone wants to take that
I'd bet he gets less that that. $16MM tops, IMO
I'd buy a bar and employ my friends definitely
I'd definitely buy a lot of high end prostitutues
Id double down
Id feel bad if he wasn't a Pats Yankees Lakers fan
I'd give her 5.13 inches of dick that's for sure
I'd go to your manager and bring up these examples, would be great if your manager was there to witness one. She's a female so bringing up anything with her in person will surely go badly
I'd guess both ends are marginal
I'd guess it's unlikely that you asking for that will result in anything positive, and might result in some negatives. If you're okay with that risk, go for it
I'd guess the base of the movement was anti-immigration, the marginal swing voters believed the latter
I'd guess they get bucketed only once and into education, especially if they're in a Lynch-esque education specific program. But while education majors don't make much, the article suggests that Lynch students will make significantly more % wise than education majors at other less prestigious (aka expensive) schools
i'd have gone with something more like more like Bill Barred from the White House
I'd have to defer to @Idris Elba there. Only one off the top of my head is ruling Prop 8 (gay marriage is illegal in CA) as unconstitutional 
I'd have to look more into it
I'd hit it
Id imagine 99% of men would go instasoft 
I'd imagine they don't have $150MM liquid lying around
I'd like to address it now because I'm thinking about trying to buy/sell some players already
I'd like to imagine he complains that the rims are bad too
I'd like to imagine the "people Marcus has made cry" list is longer than the "people Joe hates" list
I'd like to imagine Tiger woods owns a shit ton of guns and just shoots them all the time for fun 
i'd love to hear Kyle "Bullseye" Becker's two cents on Gamestop, Palantir, and Blackberry
I'd love to see the model that creditors use for student loans. Specifically I'm interested in how much they weight a students high school grades and SAT score
I'd pitch in $5 or $ 10 if anybody is interested
I'd prefer to not miss playoff football. Only week would be before Super Bowl (1/28). Since that's not viable, we'd have to do Feb 11/12 and beyond
I'd put it on a similar level as Bortles being a good keeper
Id rather be a BC fan than a Canes fan
I'd rather have the jellybeans
I'd rather have the latter
I'd rather not listen to anything than listen to a podcast on a run
I'd recommend Ghirardelli / Aquatic Park / Golden Gate Bridge all at once. If you can walk/uber, you can get to the marina and pier 39 from there. The marina is the place to go out at night if you wanna do that. Ferry Building is a bit out of the way but cool. AT&T is a must see IMHO
I'd say 35% likely KD leaves, then if he does, a 45% chance he goes to the Warriors 
I'd say 40% Rubio, 35% Cruz, 25% Trump at this point.
I'd say Bellarmine was pretty normal 99% of the time. But yeah there were always some weirdos...
I'd say Chiefs too but they've been good for 3 weeks now
I'd say he's having a relatively down year, but no, I wouldn't temper his expectations 
I'd say it's "more likely than not" that Cam took the 100 Gs, to use the official NFL terminology 
I'd say Klay is most likely to not make it
Id say like 20
I'd say MLB and NBA are tied for first. MLB all star game isn't that interesting tbh, even if it does matter. NBA game is an all offense show, so you get highlights for days
I'd say the Nats and Indians are overrated, Blue Jays underrated, Padres overrated 
I'd say the standards are lower for sure, but disagree they can't see past it if given legit exposure
i'd search online for an aero club
Id still smoke a blunt with him though. He seems like a pretty cool guy even though he's the worst foreign policy president of all time 
I'd sure hope the AthDept isn't changing their their urgency/priority based on whether or not we lose to UConn.
I'd take 1 MM for myself, then use the rest to buy as much of any Big 3 sports team I could.
Id take that bet
I'd totally be down no joke. I wish I did more (i.e. any) of that stuff while it was summer 
I'd trade AJ Green for a blank slate
Id wager the other single FH are at least equally as horny
Idc about drops. More about him only beating man coverage at an average rate while also never really being a zone guy either. And obviously not a contested catch guy either 
Idc about the shotgun start because I’m not watching lol
Idc about what weeks we play rivals personally. But if it's a crazy effort to redo it it's not a huge deal
Idc finishing a marathon is sick
Idc I want all the pat bev takes. He should have his own show
Idc if “abortion” of a drive is a typo, that’s amazing
Idc just throw a DE in there
Idc might as well wait
Idc so Brownsy it’s amazing
Idc. I'm a lax player ( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼
Idea: states should do a covid lottery. You get a ticket with your shot, first and second, for a chance to win $100k
Idea: we get all the anti-vaxxers and offer them to voluntarily get exposed to COVID. We get Herd immunity faster. It appeals to their arguments of “it’s just a harsh cold” and also the “manliness” that most of these buttholes want to project. 
Ideal first half for @Flight Tracking Szn 
Ideal post NLDS playoffs 
Ideally a crossover like a Subaru Outback or Toyota RAV4 or Honda CRV 
Ideally leaves change while we’re in 100 mile wilderness 
Idgaf I have a day off tomorrow and it’s the greatest day in my life 
Idgaf. It’s good for everybody except maybe 5 of the other 29 owners who’d even consider pulling shit like this
Idiot
"Idiots: Avengers Endgame was the most ambitious crossover event in history

Geniuses:"
"Idiots: The Olympics are great because it gives lesser known athletes a chance to shine

The NFL: Lol. Lmao. "
Idk
Idk 07-11?
Idk 1892?
Idk about exact duplicate teams but it hasn’t been an issue thus far afaik
Idk about football or basketball though
Idk about in accounting but based on my experience in consulting, there’s the partner who does the sale. Then maybe a Senior Manager who’s part of the sale and actually staffing the project. Then everybody else is just some consultant who is interchangeable irrespective to the firm. When the project is sold they haven’t even staffed the team yet. 
Idk about Joes Twitter stalker...
Idk about the daily. But Caliphate was a podcast about ISIS that largely focused around Abu Huzeifa, a Canadian guy who joined ISIS, then fled and returned to Canada, never being charged. A ton of the podcast was interviews with him and his stories about being in ISIS. Turns out this guy totally lied about joining ISIS, his whole persona was a fraud. The podcast host/producer and the NYT decided to ignore the evidence of him being a hoax during production.
Idk about the downtown city but it’s got all of Virginia. And will have Baltimore and all of Maryland in this scenario 
Idk about the food network show but yeah it's basically a promotional gig where she shows up occasionally. Her goal is to try create a pipeline from mmmBellarmine to Santa Clara where her husband coaches. Bellarmine obviously loves being able to say that Brandi Chastain is a soccer coach 
Idk about the straw, but I do remember during that conversation someone said a digging hole on the beach is not technically a hole. The kelleher test would say fuck off I spent a lot of time digging that hole. 
Idk about y’all but when I have a serious man cold I am OUT. Like sleeping 14 hours out. 
Idk according to you he was terrible until I showed up, and has made major improvements since i joined the DC elite 🤔 
Idk all the specifics, but it happens when no candidate has the required delegates to win the nomination. So all the delegates basically get in a big room and pick a nominee Pope style
Idk always had one on my squad and I'm not Pidgey or Pidgeot 
Idk Any 55+ yarder is a coin flip (except with Justin Tucker) 
Idk any of the bottom guys either except falcon who i only know as Papa Doc
Idk ask Darrow 
Idk ask Marcus 
Idk bruh he's facing an all pro linebacker all game
Idk but he continues the tradition of putting up a monster score against me
Idk but I look forward to the first class of space cadets 
Idk but they’d be smart to avoid the trap of the $150 million contract to Jones, which just got more likely with the sauce trade
Idk but we might be related
Idk Darrow's propensity to drop accountability of something without handing it off would make him a great fit for Accenture 
Idk Don called his wife ugly to his face and he just took it like a bitch. Maybe experience in a pre match lobby trained him
Idk either but we certainly could’ve done better. Which starts with taking it seriously from day one and not calling it a liberal conspiracy for a month
Idk Em could’ve thrown it back and called people fags and got standing ovations from the Arabs 
Idk Emyr. Sometimes when someone says “you won’t!” the urge is just too strong
Idk enough about pats draft history but Michel and Harry as recent 1st rounders does not look smart in hindsight 
Idk exactly what the definition is other than “view every single thing through the lens of race”. I’ve seen stuff like whiteness as a disease and privilege hierarchies and “making people be on time is a form white supremacy”. It’s complete nonsense to me.
Idk he preached no possessions while owning like 5 ferraris. That’s the kind of hypocrisy that could fit (hypothetically, if it existed)
Idk he talks about himself 90% of the time 
Idk how he did so serviceably for those 5 games 
Idk how he even has fans
Idk how he had friends
Idk how I could've gotten Czech Republic and missed Slovakia haha
Idk how I feel about the motives but the methods are objectively fascinating
Idk how jordanbot’s post could get any clearer
Idk how similar they are but multivitamins are like $10 for 100
Idk how so many people can have mahomes over Peyton at this point. Basically saying mahomes is gonna be a top 5 all time QB
"Idk how the supplying to Ukraine by NATO is going. 

Ukraine has tried to join NATO since at least the maidan revolution in 2014, probably sooner. But Russian separatists caused a civil war and there’s some clause that a country can’t join NATO while actively in a war. Even so idk if NATO would take them"
Idk how titans didn’t go for it there
Idk how true it actually is, but I’ve seen dozens of reports and videos  where white people are the ones being the chaos rioters and black people are trying to dissuade them
Idk how you can put Argo over LOTR or Forrest Gump 
Idk how you can rule this an out tho
Idk how you got Marcus to agree to this. It’s unlikely he does either of these, let alone BOTH at the same time.
Idk how you’re gonna get a cash loan of $9 trillion
Idk i don’t even get invited to DC Elite Hibachi nights
Idk I feel like 4th cousin is acceptable 
Idk i have Becker 10-8 in this round so far 
Idk I heard that fund’s management is rampant with fraud and abuse
Idk I just paid them $200 
Idk I knew a guy who got hammered and got like super strength and stamina
Idk I mean I would say the WNBA needs a Caitlin Clark but clearly there’s some disagreement about that
Idk I think he’s a heavy favorite in “breakfast on the go”
Idk I think he’s friggin awful. The repeated with/without Gase splits are too drastic over and over and over
Idk I think Joseph might be secretly pulling for his fellow Catholics 
Idk I think the nazis are pretty pro portnoy
Idk I think they make like $200k salary and $50-75k bonus. Entry level. Could be wrong tho
Idk I think you’re blowing this way out of proportion. I mean it’s such a small percentage of people who would do that, and I wouldn’t have even known about it unless it was posted here
Idk I wasn’t invited but my mom’s friend from college married the guy who owns part of the warriors (and pushed Kyle Lowry in 2019). The wife hired maroon 5 for her 60th birthday party. That’s why I know the price
Idk I’ll let y’all know
Idk if any of you are following the current RNC fiasco but holy hell, it's become Lord of the Flies
Idk if any of you have been following the Jacob Wohl/Mueller accuser story, but it’s among my favorites of the year
Idk if anybody followed but robinhood had a bug where you could get literally infinite leverage, and people on r/wallstreetbets gambled millions of dollars on single stocks. One guy lost $60,000 in the first second of markets open on a livestream
Idk if anybody is following but the whole Anthony Weiner thing is just hysterical
Idk if anybody is watching the DNC but a Bloomberg-Kaine ticket would look so fucking great right now
Idk if anybody still reads the Boston globe, but my mmmBellarmine friend Everett Cook got a job there sportswriting so if you see any bad takes, make sure to flame him with anti Bellarmine hatemail
Idk if fuelers are airport or airline employees...
Idk if Green Bay is a city 
Idk if I necessarily think that’s dumb, especially if the OL sucks as bad as it looked
Idk if it was COVID or what but when did everybody start watching anime 
Idk if it was the short season or what but I don’t know half these guys who are getting $10+ million a year contracts
Idk if it’s just the pressure or what but so many brilliant OCs just seem inept at HC
Idk if it’s the yips per se but every golfer I know has lost the ability to hit good drives for an extended period of time 
Idk if LIV is registered in the US tho
Idk if soccer has any caps at all, hard or soft like baseball
Idk if that’s a different one but there was one who said she was assaulted at lower
Idk if that’s better or worse
Idk if they count
Idk if they have a hosting fee but I'd gotta think their hosting of big events is the big moneymaker, just by number of viewers 
idk if this is real but omg
Idk it just kind of worked in my head for all of them
Idk it looks like Evans is being like “come on dude we need you”
Idk it still cool when he gets like 7+
Idk it was 60% excel and python for banks, 30% pointless meetings, and 10% contemplating suicide 
Idk it’s from PFF and I thought it was interesting 🤔 
Idk it’s like “sincere” or something like that
Idk lemme call my friend Nostradamus and find out
Idk man fake fbs and Jenn..........
Idk man imagine you go 0-5 and then you’re scared shitless
Idk man the warriors are like Charizard when he becomes too powerful for Ash and gets arrogant you’re never sure if he’s gonna take it seriously, and you’re worried about the arrogance having affected his game
Idk man. The Russia collusion part is not limited to “he wasn’t a russian agent”. It’s objectively clear his campaign was aided by the Russians and Wikileaks, and they never called the FBI. Hes repeatedly lied about these contacts. But the obstruction part is a lot more damning. Mueller said if he could clear trump he would, but he didn’t, and he also accepted the DOJ precedent that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Trumps responses to the Russia probe and efforts to kill the investigation are literally proven, such as telling Comey to let Flynn go, firing Comey, ordering Sessions to denounce the probe, etc. His other efforts to do so were even worse, but he was saved by his subordinates’ disobedience. So TLDR: I think the obstruction arguments are not weak at all, and the Barr memo succeeded in making them seem weaker than they were. Plus, Muellers decision to not bring charges to a sitting president are also saving him.
Idk maybe best 3-4 years?
Idk really. That's why Iowa is important I guess, officially cleans out the bottom feeders
Idk that little club twirl seemed like a “good time” action to me
Idk the answers to my own question, but I'm not sure increased regulation works if the people actually carrying out the regulation are poor
Idk the exact game theory behind it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the Nash equilibrium is the best team staying the best 
Idk the next time we’ll ever see an athlete like tiger 
Idk the specifics
Idk tho it's some obscure hockey team. Coyotes 
Idk to be honest. They must assume they can get a solid ROI on the money you’re “loaning” them
Idk trevor also said she is an absolute psychopath and basically the devil
Idk what it was either but I maintain you could make $60k easy 
Idk what the acceptance rate is for med students into residencies, but I'm assuming it's very high. So the bottleneck is both at med students and residencies, since that's already an efficient market
Idk what we’re doing yet, so if you have any ideas
Idk what we're doing tn but tomorrow we wanna watch UFC 205. All invited everywhere 
Idk what you’re talking about. There are no women at this chilis bar who 1) appear to be willing to sleep with me, or 2) appear to be wife material
Idk wherever he was working I guess. Didn't think it through because it's too funny to be real
Idk which photo I love more, this one or Joey finance on the golf course
Idk who he was even throwing to there
Idk who matt Berry is, but I think 3 is a pretty easy pick, then 4
Idk why but I find that hysterical
Idk why but I think I’m rooting for the lakers to take it
Idk why I'm interested in these every year. They never change
Idk why it’s become such an iconic video so fast but I’m here for it 
Idk why it's hate worthy
Idk why quality was so bad in above photo
Idk why Rodgers would leave anyway unless he’s that big of a prima donna as his haters claim 
Idk why she’s taking 64 pills every day when she can just pop one of these and be fully cured
Idk why that’s under cringe because that’s hilarious
Idk why the sox and Giants are copromoting but hey it works for me
Idk why they released him. It's not like they're gonna save their season by getting a better player
Idk why you don’t just drop a defense on bye
Idk why you’re setting yourself up for Marcus to demand you run with him, refuse unless you do, then beat you
Idk why. TV should be raking in the viewership right now 
Idk you may underestimate the chief influence 
Idk your math but I got 6 second 40 to be 4:24 mile 
Idk, i think Obama tried and failed (not that anybody would’ve succeeded, but he did get a Nobel peace prize 🤔). Also the US provides something like $250MM to Palestine so that is certainly leverageable. 
Idk, saw a lot of guesses that they improve the defense even more, and can never have too many good OLs
Idk, why would MLK?
Idk. I saw 1-3 tho (didn’t finish because I didn’t care) but hunger games 2 was objectively awesome
Idk. I think that’s besides the point tho
Idk. If they win and get snubbed that might be 4 months of 🍑❌
Idk. It’s probably conditions based. Like if I was in a hotel pool alone and had to pee, I don’t see myself getting out of the pool to pee 
Ie a yes vote will be made if need be
Ie player is drafted for $1, dropped and added by Jeff for $20, then dropped and added by you for $5. You could keep him for $15
Ie why shouldn’t she get convicted of negligent homicide  
Ie you get scapegoated for everything bad, and no kudos when you succeed 
Ie, is my understanding that my 2014-17 cap gains income will be tax free correct? And does reinvesting change that?
If @Endowed Department Chair Of Asstronomy were a cop
If 3000 people are dying every day, every day matters 
If a normal president won, I think I might keep Obama as a top advisor. Despite my opinion of him, people really seem to like his cult of personality, so just having him show face a lot could be big trying to unite the partisans 
If a Pats player did that, they wouldn't suit up
If a QB is slowing down as he heads toward the sideline, then cuts downfield for a few more yards, that’s genius. But preventing that is not apparently 
If a registered Democrat can do it, anyone can
If an American who is fluent in French told me they’re going to pah-ree, they’re a huge douche
If an unheralded player surprises and takes a team far, is there any value for the team to demonstrate loyalty to that player? Guys like Keenum, Foles, etc. got me thinking
If any of us posted us doing that in fuckswoles we would get 0 hearts
If any of y’all are interested in what I’m doing here at the pentagon, this article actually does a really good job summarizing. My boss’ boss LtGen Hinote is quoted a lot
If any rank and file did this they’d be in Leavenworth so fast
If anybody else has stipulations, please present them now
If anybody ever told me they’d create a bing doc I would call the police
If anybody has costumes lying around I'll take it hahaha. I'm at dinner with my parents can't make it to a store just yet. Gonna be eleventh hour...
If anybody is interested, this is my next job description
If anybody is into Reddit karma you have a r/wsb goldmine with that thread 
If anybody plays the new Doodie on PS4 add me
If anybody wants to see Powerglove do metal covers of video game music in Brooklyn, y’all are invited 
If anybody, Warner over CMC is the maybe
If anything baseball needs a team minimum salary floor
If anything you should be happy nobody bid on Wallace
If Bank of America gets "broken up", does it just spawn a bunch of local subsidiaries?
If BC opens at 5.5, do you take it?
If becker doesn't go I don't think I can either
If becker goes 0/11 against Marcus after claiming to go at least 50% in the literal World Cup, the financial loss will be worth it
If Bill Cosby was a Pokemon he would be Hypno
If Brady appeals, is the suspension upheld until/unless the Supreme Court overturns it?
If Brady could fucking throw and catch the ball at the same time, he'd be the 🐐, but as we all know, he can't, so he loses
If Brady wins MVP or a super bowl it's pretty much unarguable, IMO
If Bruce Jenner shows up that would be the greatest thing of all time
If Bruce Jenner shows up that would be the greatest thing of all time
If by "get his life together" you mean stop making videos and being a social media legend, then no. If you mean continue to be delusionally optimistic but achieve realistic strides toward a real career and be happy and confident in himself, then yes
If by "people" you mean Trevor one time, and by "real dad" you mean like Darth Vader which would make me the Luke Skywalker of football, then yes 
if by "redskins" you mean Football Team and not a technicality, i'd take that bet
If Caleb is just the same as he was in college (incredible talent, mental midget, Gen Z weirdo) for his whole NFL careee
If Chan had not quit and I had not been invited to this league, Chan probably would've underperformed relative to me and Becker would've made the playoffs
If chuck leaves TNT we’re invading Saudi Arabia. (Monaco was just the first step)
If Clowney doesn’t give up and that’s a strip sack
If CNN doxxed you becker, you'd get expelled from med school and your career would be over. Because you said some things some time which you didn't know at the time would ever be a big deal
If Covid truly did come naturally from a bat in Wuhan, that is a hell of a coincidence 
If Darrow fought Chuck Liddell, I think I'd put money on Darrow
If David Stern and Roger Goodell were ever on stage at the same time, the boos might rip a hole in the space time continuum
If don has truly lost Marcus and Mrs becker, he’s not in great shape 
If Don lifted his AG from the Alabama senate, his endorsed guy lost the primary, then his endorsed guy lost the General, flipping a senate seat blue in ALABAMA, only to fire said AG within 2 years... that would be one of the funniest unforced errors of all time
If each of us were a subreddit, what would we be?
If economic growth really is the #1 priority, then you simply want free market economics. Too bad Rand already dropped he was your guy 
If either of them go, quite high. If not, quite low
If Eli gets in, it’s because of the “you can’t tell the story of the NFL without him” loophole 
If everyone in America read the Fantasy Fuckholes groupme, the country would be a better place
If fields is in the MVP conversation, DJ Moore should actually win MVP
If Flo Rida and Jason Derulo taught me anything, it's that all it takes is the remastering of and old catchy beat to make a hit
If he deposits with that link then I get $25 referral bonus. After that, Jesus has the wheel
If he didn’t immediately respond with “well let’s see you put that head to work” then that’s a major miss
If he doesn’t I volunteer in his stead
If he gets elected, which is unlikely
If he gets in there’s a tier of like 8 guys who all of a sudden have arguments 
If he had a precedent of playing hard then sure
If he had to carry a team he’d be Harrison Barnes 
If he leaves again he would truly be the best anti hero in sports history
If he said yes that’s a gift to republicans 
If he screws you out of $2000, you’re gonna make sure he doesn’t walk scot free
If he successfully threw a perfect game and his career ended, I think it would be worth it
If he wants to leave because he doesn't like the direction of the program or the campus atmosphere or whatever then that's fine. If he's upset only because he's not the golden boy since he split carries with another freshmen, I don't get that 
If he was just being edgy lmao
If he was, how would he be acting differently?
If he wore a pats hat for 2 seconds in the background of an episode, he'd be your favorite character in TV show history
if he’s a stud in the NFL, it’s easy to say “of course, he was amazing in college.” And if he busts, it’s easy to say “of course, he’s 5’9 170”
"If he’s dead, the Biggest thing is that Raisi was expected to be the next Ayatollah, and current Ayatollah Khamenei is gonna die any month/year now. The Iranians spent a lot of time choosing Raisi for presidency for that exact purpose.

So basically it makes the chances of a not-smooth transition post-Khamenei more likely than previous."
If he’s right tho, doesn’t he have a point?
If he's really tryin, I'm voting for Ryan
If his total interest lost in many others equals his gained interest in one 
If Hurts’ strength is the difference maker, i wonder why other teams don’t try it with an RB as the ball carrier.
If I break 83 I consider it a great round
If I come up for Memorial Day (and one of you would be willing to host me), then yes I'd be down for dinner

If I didn’t shave for 3 months i think I’d look like Dario Saric
If I didn't have this London trip pending I would've fucked outta here hours ago. But no, my nose has to be 3 feet up my bosses asshole and he fucking knows it, that cocksucker
If I do a 12 I will not be back by then
If I don’t get accepted I’m tracking him down like the secret police and beating him into submission until he accepts me, because it’s for the good of the proletariat

If I had him I’d trade him for Jonathan Taylor 
If I had known there would be a keeper limit I would've drafted totally differently
If I had somebody worth stalking like anesto I totally would
If I had to choose a team from a random pool of people to do anything, and all I knew was where they stood on Ukraine - Russia and Israel - Hamas, I bet I could pick a really good team
If I keep saying it, it's gonna happen
If I ran a newspaper, I think I'd have a weekly section of "things trump did but they don't really matter", as opposed to making every single thing a headline 
If I see a kid with an I voted sticker, I should arrest him for voter fraud right?
If I see Bernie I’m gonna ask him if he likes Wendy’s

If I was an RB I’d be pissed too
If I was feeling adventurous, I’d probably try walk up to some Mexicans at the park and say “I just PCS’d here and I’ve never had Mexican food” and I bet they’d be like “ay caramba try this” and give me some dank ass Mexican food 
If I was poor and in LIC looking for a job, I would jump at the opportunity to work in maintenance for Amazon 
If I was Rachel fagut I would change my name 
If I was still in RHA (and my ideas wouldn't get vetoed by stupid administration) I would hold a Stephen A Smith impersonation contest
If I was the devil, I would sentence the most evil souls to be die hard jets fans

If I were a Democrat, I’d pick a different candidate (of which there are MANY) and not die on the Bernie hill
If i were a Sox fan I’d be happy with it
If I were a tits Doctor I would hire dudes to hang out outside the office and not look twice at girls who walk in, then when a girl walks out be like "damnnnn girl"
If I were Biden I would go way lighter on all the policy talk and just talk about what a train wreck the trump admin has been
If I were them
If I were you I’d find the closest thing to a mentor in your company and ask him/her. Your downside if you do bill the hours is reputation at work. Your downside if you don’t bill the hours is you’re working against your goals as stated by the company
If I won them I’d want them honored, so I gotta pony up even if I go 0-5

If it was China or Russia, guy would be in a gulag 
If it was just Green for Diggs, would THAT be okay??
If it was properly classified and he declassified it then yes, but I’m getting the impression Sec Navy’s reason was about going outside the chain of command, not a classification thing
If it wasn’t racist then it’s something probably said every single game

If it’s true that mismanagement or some other reason results in fewer vaccines than scheduled, that’s unconsciously bad
If it's easier to get that job, yes
If it's mechanical failure or overbooking, then yes it is. But it's usually demand for runways > supply, which means it's basically a coin flip and ATC decides

If klobuchar wins, I’m 100% voting for her. If it’s any of the other declared candidates so far, I’ll prob vote third party. Booker is a maybe. 
If Latinos break hard toward Trump and midwestern white people save the Dems, I will laugh so hard seeing the progressive spin zone
If Lavar Ball gets into a fight with Stephen A Smith in the ESPN cafeteria, I think it would be confirmed

If Mac Jones is good I’m gonna be mad
If mahomes foot is 3 inches left it’s a clean hit
If Marcus' championships don't count, then Goody you need to drop your players kept from before auction waiver was implemented 
If Marcus orders us prostitutes, that could literally be true
If Marcus WD from the FIRST round how does that affect the total score? 🤔

If none of them have a majority, then the GOP National Convention sits in a room and talks about it until they decide on a candidate. I don't think it's ever happened before.

If playing these games actually convinces 30% of the country that American democracy is a farce, that is extremely dangerous. I agree that in 2 months trump will slither away without issue, but the ripple effects are not to be brushed off.

If the republicans hold the senate, which they seem likely to, the whole court packing shenanigans goes out the window thankfully
If the scale of those operations on US territory matches that of terrorist networks, then that's something that definitely needs attention. But clearly it doesn't, and terrorism is clear and present organized threat to the western world. 
If the second place guy doesn't set his line up, all unwritten rules are off the table. Do anything to win. 
If the trend keeps up maybe you will all decide to vote for Rubio in 2017
If the utility is the guys interest, then if you think he can be more interested in a girl while not decreasing his interest in another, it’s not a zero sum game. If you think his interest in one means automatic loss of interest in another, it is a zero sum game

If they can overcome their difficulties off the field, they can do so on the field. My god groundbreaking idea. 
If they have opinions on how the offense should be conducted, they already have an above average shot at draining the 3
If they increased scoring by widening the goals or modifying the offside rule or something, I'd be more interested. I just don't like how shot that misses the goal by 10 feet is the most exciting thing that happens every 20 minutes 
If they’re cool with that then sure. I’m pretty sure they state all their requirements online or on the receipt or something, including carryon bag size. Just make sure you follow all of them
If they’re secretly antifa wouldnt the MAGAs call for all of them to be arrested 🤔

If you are a solid golfer but have a bad day, usually you at least have a bunch of good shots and a handful of bad ones. Tom has all bad shots, across all shot types 
If you beat the S&P you should be happy. Independent of that, 10% annually is a pretty good benchmark given how fickle the market is

If you want to have more people just say you’re protesting and then there’s no limit 
If you want you can use me and I get you a VA loan. Just the property would have to be in my name. I’ll help you out with mortgage like $100 a month
If you want your kid to have a 4.0, it’s important for their teachers to think their dad is hot
If you watched any of the debates, you'd notice how the moderators pivoted away every single time he got questioned heavily. Fox News was essentially a Trump advertisement for 3 months. MSNBC held Trumps own Town Hall for him. They let him cancel 2 debates. 
If you were a fan of a team that moved away, would you still root for that team?
If you were a girl, who would you rather date: Anesto or Bill Coughlin

If you’re playing the Ners and could remove a player from the game, CMC is like the 6th option on the list
If you’re serious this is the best compliment I’ve ever gotten
If you’re the Texans and you suddenly get the best RB in the league you’re still gonna suck.
If you're 50% accurate, your odds of hitting are 1.56%. If you're a beast and you're 60%, it's 4.67%.  
If you're going to spy, you need to draw a line on what is arrest worthy and what is not. I choose to draw the line at "intent to murder as many people as you can for no reason". That's all. 
If you're gonna do that, write in McMullin 
If you're gonna leave in a year or so then just take the promotion. If you're planning on staying long term you have to play the long game I guess.
If you're really lucky you can snag a 'gansett for $5

If you're the Cs what do you want for the first overall?
Iggy shooting 3 times in a row. Bad decisions...
Ignore him for now
Ignoring the "only Fuckholes league" rule for a moment. In 24B league going into tonight, Becker was down 15.1 points. He had Lamar Miller and Jankowski, facing good old Latavius. Ended up losing by 1 point
IIRC A bunch of people planned on doing a Die in where lied on the floor at some performance in devlin 008. BC disallowed it because it was a fire hazard. 
IIRC Fauci revised his estimate to 80-90%
IIRC Fauci’s numbers initially were 70-80%, then later 80-85%. Idk if that’s out of “an abundance of caution” or what, but 80% seems like it’s in the ballpark 
IIRC Fields was a late faller after being the consensus #2 by pundits earlier on. 
IIRC he bought Twitter because he was legally forced to (failing in his attempt to get out of it) after making legally binding “jokes”
IIRC he reportedly would insult the defensive practice squad players after they would make a stop
IIRC high school physics, Lift is generated by wind over the wing going faster than the wind under the wing. The plane is going zero mph. No lift
IIRC I messaged Jeff on Facebook
IIRC I was just watching football the whole time
IIRC it was a bunch of 6 footers?
IIRC it was last mentioned in here when some county did a gun buyback program, so a guy made dozens of crude guns that were little more than barrels and firing pins but they worked, and got $100 or whatever for each gun he “sold”
IIRC it was Mitch Tribusky that won NVP, not Mitch Trubisky
IIRC last week Joe said something along the lines of “I would pay $20 to not travel with goody”
IIRC Marcus’ brother in law is also a Justin 🤔 🤔 🤔 
IIRC she was the face of peaceful resistance when the muslim junta was in power Myanmar. Then she got power, her people went on a revenge genocide, and she looked the other way. 
IIRC some projected him as a first rounder
IIRC the courts decided it is funnier to let him continue to punch himself in the face with hilarious political stunts
IIRC the FH Open 1 was held during March madness on a day that Houston lost 
IIRC the narrative was that Goff was purely a product of McVay and has proven to be accurate 
IIRC there was a game in 2013 that Peyton Manning’s broncos were favored over Jacksonville by 28
IIRC There was a psychological study that wanted to see the effects of solitary confinement. It had to be shut down because not a single person could last more than a week
IIRC There was like a 4 game stretch in the middle of 2019 where Jones got the Gluck Gluck treatment
IIRC they just mortgage everything into the indefinite future. Aka the social security method
IIRC this was also Tennis Ball of Justice night
IIRC you asked Marcus when you could babysit
IIRC you said last week they’re gonna lose first round in the playoffs which I agree is a good take
IIRC, CS is more coding based. IS is more toward application/database design and framework.
IIRC, sensitivity is true positive rate, specificity is true negative
IIRC. I think a salary floor is pretty silly. cutting off the nose to spite the face 
I'll accept that
I'll admit he's no good anymore, but he never had tommy John or anything
I'll admit I significantly underestimated the magnitude of the reduction of draftable WRs...
I'll agree on no balls Becker. I will not admit you were safe because that's a lie against God and Country, and I don't do that
I'll be back back in Cali Cali. But we can still do it on skype ;)
I'll do it but only for the T shirts
I'll do it NCAA march madness style, point value per round for each correct pick. Objections?
I'll do it tn
I'll get a photo of her in the next few days
I'll give you credit becks: you sure are optimistic about the things you support
I'll have to look at all the language tonight
"I'll never fly united again!*

*unless the flight time and price is the most convenient "
I'll never forget the day I got home from work and Connor was hanging out in my apartment while Rob was passed out next to a pyramid of bud heavys and the first thing Connor says "DUDE HE DRANK THE WHOLE THIRTY!!"
I'll never forget watching that girl fall out of a cab into a pool of mud 
Ill never understand why people hate DC
I'll open wager $10. Any takers?
I'll play devils advocate. He's nothing more than a good shooter who plays tight D for his position, but still doesn't guard the opponents best scorer ever 
I'll play devils advocate. Without the threat of a lawsuit, contracts would be essentially meaningless. That would be worse than the other way around. I just hate how the process is all about the language of the contract, and not about the actuality of what happened 
I'll prob just put garlic powder and olive oil on them or something
"I'll rank them then:
1) Cam
2) Brady
3) Rodgers
4) Luck
5) Wilson
6) Big Ben"
I'll read when I have a minute, i generally don't think a president has much if any control over the economy, especially in his own term. But yeah I'll read it
I'll say 23-13 Pats.
I'll see anything with Darrowball in it
I'll slake my depression by thinking of my guaranteed fantasy football success
I'll snap what her desk looks like later today. Except not sending to Joff or Goodwin
I'll start. What is the maximum number of pitches a batter can see in a single Plate Appearance without ever making contact with the ball?
I'll start: Sam Adams for winter, though I'll take Spaten Oktoberfest if they have it. I like Ommegang Witte for summer which is popular in NY, but I'm cool with Blue Moons too
I'll take 3 and 4 as well.
I'll take alternative suggestions, but I can't think of a better one
I'll take Bell or OBJ, whichever you can't keep 
I'll take it
Ill take it 
I'll take it Becker
I'll take NE
I'll take Story of My Life for $600 Alex
I'll take that bet
I'll take that bet
I'll take that bet
Ill tell you if I can buy out of the trump bet now 
I'll throw a toaster in
I'll trade AJ Green for a blank slate
I'll weigh in now: I'm strongly for it. We know terrorists exist and any method that can stop mass murder should be executed. That being said, I think there needs to be a provision, perhaps even a constitutional amendment, that says the ONLY thing that the Federal government can arrest you through NSA spying is conspiracy to commit mass murder. 
Illmatic is very good, but it still weirds me out how simultaneously simple and groundbreaking it was. Its like how Star Wars A New Hope was a sci fi masterpiece, but it’s lightsaber battles seem so lame by today’s standards
im 100% opposite of becker's take on mixing friend groups
I'm 1000% pro rendition, and all the Obama talk about rendition and Guantanamo being propaganda for terrorism has clearly been proven bullshit
I'm a big proponent of environmental sustainability as a long term policy goal, though I don't know shit about where we are really. I thought the big problems were 1) big players not adhering to their agreed upon goals, and 2) major polluters like China not giving a shit
I'm a grumpy old man now!
Im a pretty big skeptic of that claim right now
Im a what person not a why person
I'm about to download bumble and tinder. These traveling projects get you lonely quick
I'm absolutely dying at the Delaware party post
I'm actually incredibly interested in this answer
I'm actually not sure it's possible but I'll ask
I'm adding her to my list of Internet celebs who's salad I would toss
I'm afraid one of us is gonna have a serious family tragedy and goody is gonna make a funny
I'm against it. Doesn't change anything, and it eliminates the one in a thousand chance of a wild pitch or hit 
Im all about taste:effort ratio
Im all in on Conley 
I'm almost certain
I'm almost happy I'm not in playoff contention. The Zeke suspension would hurt way more
I'm already hitting him as hard as I possibly can 
Im also coming off by far my most lucrative year ever so I’m riding the high
I'm also for a tennis ball direct to the back from point blank range as hard as you can
I'm also impressed by his golf skill, but still more impressed that he's on pace to be by far the best shooter of all time...
I'm also not invited to the wedding
I'm also not very warm in general and also bad at hiding my dislike for people, so that certainly doesn't do my any favors
I'm also starting a gofundme so you guys can send your condolences in the form of small donations
I'm always interested in stuff like that, but I'm wary of the future value already being baked in. If you have numbers though I'd be very interested 
I'm at the airport and I found Becker's doppelgänger 
I'm attacking the person defending trump, that's all I know
I'm basically thinking on crackers 
I'm betting hard on lung transplant technology
I'm bringing up an analogy that is directly relevant to his point
I'm busy
I'm calling that bullshit hahaha, sure maybe cig smoke is worse than the same amount of car exhaust, but aggregate volume wise, that's bananas
I'm calling Virginia safe Clinton
I'm cautious about making any more concrete statements, but I'm still quite confident that Bernie has no shot
I'm Commander Shepard, and Mass Effect is my favorite series on the citadel
Im confident I could do it
I'm conflicted
I'm conflicted. Yes would love that but also Cubs fans have been huge buttheads all season and they eliminated the good guys
I'm confused are we talking about tax policy, quality of comedy tv, or fantasy football
I'm confused. Do y'all want to trade Jimmy G, or just hoping for a kings ransom?
I'm confused: you know you're getting laid and you jerk off, or you jerk off unless you know you're getting laid
I'm considering just ratting on Marcus 
I'm convinced Boston GMs have Jedi mind tricks to convince other GMs to make these retarded trades
im counting that as a yes
I'm crying hahahaha
I'm curious about players being able to make money from their likeness off the field
I'm curious on hearing their argument for the compsci Trend in my graph tho. It's a high skill high paying job
I'm curious to what a Reddit thread would say about this
I'm curious what your other ideas were before the military and the Danielle 
I'm dying hahahahahahaa
I'm embarrassed and I'm not even in it
I'm en route to one at Battery Park. Will let you know what it's like
I'm enjoying this league history lesson
Im excited for you to come to Dallas
I'm exhausted from yesterday...
I'm expecting me plus 3
I'm facing Deangelo Williams and Julio in both leagues. When Julio caught his Hail Mary followed seconds later by Williams touchdown after the nullified pick six, I was pretty pissed
I'm fairly confident I could do each of those individually. Together, nearly impossible 
I'm fine with goodwin as commissioner. I don't care that he's not in the league
Im flabbergasted
I'm flabbergasted 
I'm flabbergasted 
I'm following game cast in the car. What just happened?
I'm following on game cast this is insane
I'm for anything that levels the playing field, regardless of rarity of occurrence. The pro of this change is that in situations like this, everyone has an equal shot at an FA who becomes a hot pickup. The con is that you have to plan ahead for questionable players on all games after Sunday at 1pm
I'm for the presence too - girls should be able to get abortions if they want, and I don't care about secrecy either. I'm not for the funding - I don't want force the country to pay for their abortions, especially when planned parenthood nets profit every year 
I'm free every weekend after July 16/17
I'm free every weekend until march, would enjoy a ride from Becker or Bourque as per usual
I'm free Sunday anytime after golf
I'm getting a maintenance page? 
I'm getting beat so bad fantasy just logged me out
I'm going first week of March, what does that mean for me then?
I'm going to the game. I assume he will not be. 
I'm gonna be in an insane asylum a few years from now
I'm gonna be so disappointed when HRC goes to war with ISIS and repeats 2003 all over again.
I'm gonna bet that none of those guys are top 5
I'm gonna call myself pidgeotto
I'm gonna change my avi to Carson Palmer
I'm gonna cheat on the SAT tomorrow
I'm gonna go ham on lucky egg evos today, then start for real
I'm gonna go with the lowest sum of the margins of error of each team's score, unless anybody had a better idea
I'm gonna guess Jeff
I'm gonna have to sift through the thread now and see the commentary I missed
I'm gonna look this shit up because I remember it being like $40 minimum
im gonna need hints and also some groupme participation
I'm gonna print it out and put it on my fridge
I'm gonna pull a whodini on you
I'm guessing die hard Raptors fan Drake was not in attendance
I'm half expecting it's a late April fools joke
I'm half rooting for Lonzo to bust because of his dad, and I don't think I'm alone there 
I'm halfway there...
I'm happy when you fail and sad when you succeed. Ryan helped you succeed, so I'm sad and mad at him for helping you
Im having deja vu
I'm higher on BC than goody is, but not as high as you
I'm holding out hope that he's going to un-endorse Trump, now that Sen Kirk has done so. He's still a spineless coward, but he's my favorite spineless coward
I'm holding you to that ;)
I'm honestly excited for you
I'm in an 8 man snake draft league with 4 people who don't really know football. Pretty fun putting up 140 every week hahahaha
I'm in Boston with Trevor and connor 
I'm in for Friday
Im in on the bills baby
I'm in Ops and Technology. I don't do any actual market research
I'm inducing from Tyler the Creator, Azaelia Banks, Joakim Noah, and many many many other professional athletes
I'm inspired by all of you athletes
I'm interested in hearing @Joff Savarino 's pick
I'm itching for distractions so if anybody has a #5 I'm all thumbs
I'm just combining irrespective and regardless. Shakespeare does it all the time
I'm just confused
I'm just curious how it's possible 
I'm just flabbergasted.... 
I'm just glad you don't have the one of me from fresh year Halloween when I went to st Es...
I'm just picturing flavor of love, except less melanin
I'm laughing so hard hahahaha 
I'm like 90% sure Matt is Kylo Ren
I'm likely moving that weekend but yeah should be able to make some time
I'm liking this trade  
I'm literally moving 2 blocks east if all goes well
I'm literally only trying to make my team better
Im looking at a 2009 Elantra off Craigslist for $3900 asking... any idea how much I should be asking for?
I'm looking for something slightly better than "douse with ketchup"
I'm mixed on it so far... I feel the opposite of trapped because there is sooooo much stuff packed into a tiny space. There are endless things to do and it's all basically walking distance. But there is no community, and it's literally the middle of NYC so every time you step out the door you go from tiny apartment to the always eccentric mix of people
I'm more offended by this than gifs of naked girls
I'm mostly with John here, but with some key exceptions. Rubio was one of the key members of the Gang of Eight immigration bill that eventually didn't pass Congress. Basically it agreed to secure the border, allow only a few thousand immigrants in for work visas a year, but also grant amnesty to existing illegals. Cruz has roasted Rubio over this, saying he's for amnesty because it was in his bill. In reality, Rubio was conceding that point to the Democrats on the committee. Does Rubio believe in amnesty? He says he doesn't, but he has officially supported it. 
Im moving out tomorrow. #tbt to when Becker helped me move in 2 years ago 
I'm not a "good" skier, but I've yet to find a slope I can't get down one way or another
Im not a fan of the logo
I'm not addicted to cigarettes, I'm addicted to drugs!
I'm not as positive as you about BC's recent ranks in academics and "jesuit-ness" but I'm rather uninformed on both of those things anyway... Is there tangible evidence that BC is improving in those areas?
I'm not calling you a hypocrite, it's just interesting
I'm not dead yet Becker haha
I'm not even going to correct that
I'm not gifting anything. I'm trading 2 valuable players for future value. This is the whole fucking point of having keepers
I'm not gonna add that guy on snapchat. I don't want myself anywhere occupying space in that kids head
Im not gonna claim to be better than Chan until I beat him #lessonsfromanesto
I'm not in love with her. Always thought she was overrated tbh
I'm not looking at this from a personal standpoint , I'm looking at it from a legal standpoint. And if you write a law knowing that there's the possibility of abuse, and that the abuse could lead to dire consequences, then the law isn't a good law. 
I'M NOT OWNED
I'm not pinning anything on Obama. I'm saying Trump's Election is going to be a big part of his legacy, deserved or not.
I'm not quitting on the season! I didn't go to Joe and say "I'll give you anybody you want"
im not saying its smart, but thats probably what their angle is
I'm not saying premed students are KP doctors, I'm saying it's a different type of training, closer to a military medic and EMT
im not sure exactly how the lottery works but yeah with your definition i agree
I'm not sure he's ever won a fight where he wasn't on steroids/testosterone, and I'm not sure he's ever lost a fight where he was. 
I'm not sure I could travel 50 miles in 3 days
I'm not sure if that's abnormal though... doesn't every president appoint their own State Dept officials?
I'm not sure she's qualified to work at McDonald's...
I'm not sure what I'm more impressed by, the 73 HR season, the back to back to back to back MVPs, or leading the league in OBP in his final season in 2007
I'm not. But 1) he successfully skirted punishment, and 2) the obvious outcome of that is that he quits again if he loses instead of taking the SAT
im not. people like uber and the prop would kill it
I'm of the opinion that social impacts should be the main force here, and that the social repercussions will be enough to deter and denounce that kind of bigotry. But for the government, I think you generally let it slide.
I'm old enough to remember when republicans would complain that liberals wanted to raise their taxes
i'm on a web browser so i dont have access to the finger guns :(
I'm on team Fun to Hate Them, so fuck Lavar, Lamelo, and Lonzo, and all of them! I'm rooting for them all to fail! #RuleOfTen
I'm on the bench at work. I've done literally nothing for 3 days hahaha
I'm on the bus up just listening to Spotify and it came on, and I was like "I bet Chan knows how"
I'm on the client site and client machine 24/7. I can check my email from here but not log into skype
Im on your side hear but no you don’t care about Oregon State alums
I'm picking TWill to go all the way. That man brought me so much joy for weeks on end. TWill FTW!!
I'm pretty I can singlehandedly crash the Pokemon go servers 
I'm pretty sure "max CP" is the most important, since you can't change that no matter how much candy/dust
I'm pro choice too. I just think it's ridiculous that the "unite as women against Trump" movement is excluding women who don't think how they want them to think 
I'm pro choice. Argument is that it's not the govts job to tell you what you can and can't do with your body. And it's not the govts job to determine that a fetus is a person. Personally I would choose life if it happened to me
I'm quite aware of the differences between the US and every other country ever haha. It'd be comparable to trying to make a system for the entire EU. 
I'm raging right now haha
I'm reading backwards. Gotta go through these power rankings.
I'm reading that it was simply for the purposes of printing. Unconfirmed reports of course
I'm reading this is essentially a one off thing. Like obviously very fucked up, but not like he banned them permanently. At least that's what it appears at this point 
I'm really curious to see what NO can do with the 2 best bigs in the league
I'm really truly afraid we don't recover from this
I'm retarded
I'm ripping this oil pen on the plane and the lady next to me keeps looking at me like I'm a psycho haha
I'm rooting for Golden State
I'm rooting for you John 
I'm rooting hard for Spacey
I'm running out of gas lol
I'm sad none of you got my Aqueous Martini reference
I'm same as becker here. I can't tell the difference if it's mcdonalds or dunkin or Starbucks
I'm same as you for the most part Joe, but I care a lot more about the immediate ramifications of foreign policy and immigration than I do about everything else. 
I'm saying make more buckets. 
I'm saying that and the Rawls situation both should be prevented next year
I'm saying that if you're saying pro ISIS things on Twitter, I want the government to hack the shit out of you and investigate if you're making a bunch of shady offshore transactions, or if you're buying tons of fertilizer. If you are, boom: arrested. If you're just some 13 year old goth kid, at least the government knows that now. 
I'm seeing bad for trump, good for Rubio amongst early voting
I'm shocked anybody even considered the possibility of me being able to grow a beard
I'm smiling to myself, reminiscing on that fateful morning where I checked my roster, initially disappointed that I did not bid enough to claim Terrance Williams. That disappointment immediately turned into incredulous shock when I ventured over to the waiver auction recap page and saw the number next to Williams's name; and that shock transformed into gleeful laughter when I saw the team name who placed that $51 bid. That feeling would have been enough for TWill to get my 🐐 nomination, but little did i realize, Becker wasnt done yet. Standing boldly and defying all logic and reason, Becker proceeded to defend his bid, saying that it actually makes him happier that he overbid by an inordinate amount, and that we would all eventually realize his genius. The following weeks of piss poor performances only sweetened the emotion. Several weeks later, Terrance Williams emitted his last pulse of joy as he was dropped from Team Becker. 
"I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"

I'm still confused about the level thing. If I catch a pkmn at lvl 10 that is full CP bar at 200, is 200 its max CP, or does max CP increase as I level up? 
I'm still not athletic enough to hop the fence
I'm still wondering what the best format for the Becker segment is. Should it be an Olbermann-esque nonstop rant? Or a 1v1 with guests like First Take? Or just him with a guest like Jim Rome? Or a get a question, have an answer, repeat format?
I'm strongly against it because I think it made shit worse for the average American patient, much worse for the doctors, and didnt so much for the previously uninsured, and on top of that it is absolutely failing from an economic and finance perspective. But that's mostly a result from me reading about it and I was wondering if those closer to its effects felt the same.

In the same vein, I tried to get the disciplinary policies changed (e.g. If you have to do community service, you shouldn't be allowed to pay your way out of it). They nodded heads and then ignored me forever. 
In the same vein, what cities do people think are going to come up in the next 10-20 years? Oakland is already halfway there, for example. What's next?
In the unlikely event that this happens
In the very long run, inflation adjusted annualized return is 6-7% 
In theory I like the concept. Advantages are the same as for fantasy drafts: equal shots at each player, might reduce tanking. Biggest immediate downside is that it gives major advantages to already good teams who can spend it all on just one player to fill the last hole, and therefore might reduce parity
In theory, only 5 or so teams have a need at QB
In this case Buzzfeed got a hold of that doc and published it. Probably shouldn't have, but at least they admit it's unconfirmed by anybody

Indiana Jones even in the same ballpark as FF? Yeah those be fighting words
Indiana Jones junior

Indians... bad bad mistakes
Indistinguishable from parody
Inevitable is truly the best word
INF is a rough ERA
Informative featured snaps as always
Informative thread on a smart guys thoughts on the limbo the government is in right now 
Initial thoughts on pursuing it further?
Initially they wanted to be annexed by Russia. Then there was the short lived idea of Novorossiya. The grassroots rebel leaders were assassinated (probably by Russia) and replaced by lackeys of Putin. Russia would rather them be a thorn in Ukraine’s side, where they have stayed for 8 years. 
Injury prognosis must be pretty good
Insane
Insane play
Insane weekend
Insanity
Insanity
INSANITY
Insanity
Insecurity at their small dicks
Insta KO. His arms totally locked up
Insta lost respect 
Instant kick from the group chat
Instant Pot meal of the week is Thai red chicken curry
Instead he gets crushed by the best DL in the league :(
Instead I have to watch dumbass people play dumbass wheel of fortune
Instead of saying “no actually our embassy will stay open, no cause for concern” 2 days before the city falls
Instead of stabbing people in my fucking lobby

Insulting, but fair
Insurance as a whole practice or insurance as the industry currently works? 
Intel is soft power, but it’s useless without hard power behind it.
Intelligence community. FBI, CIA, NSA, etc
Intended to reply to this
Interesting article on panthers website today about the deal expected to be Texans trade up to 1, then bears trade down again to the panthers. But the Texans dragged their feet so hard that the panthers just took it from them
Interesting because it I’ve been hoping you’d wanna CDs NUTS
Interesting Boys and Bills over Colts. And Bears bottom 5 wow
Interesting choice to distance from the claws
Interesting choice with 5. Trout and Drake, two of the best in the game by the numbers, but also still generally described as lame
Interesting convo on the future of the ACA and the healthcare industry:
Interesting economic food for thought:
Interesting emoji use 
Interesting eraser marks on 10 🤔 
Interesting first 2 plays...
Interesting point from a right wing pundit: Obama worked like hell to earn his voters in 2008, then he worked even harder to re-earn them in 2012. Hillary assumed she had them in the bag the whole time. 
Interesting postmortem that explains a lot
Interesting stat line there 🤔
Interesting take from a very good analyst 
Interesting that 5/10 teams who saved the Brotherly Shove are the 5 worst franchises in NFL history
Interesting that Colts odds went up after a loss
Interesting that MA and NH have by far the highest deltas between partial and full 
Interesting that reigning champs in the big 3 are all runner ups from last year or year before
Interesting that the only 2 baseball only cities were the 2 teams that lost their NFL teams this year
Interesting thought experiment on what a >2 party system might look like 
Interesting thread on how paying CFB players might affect the rest of college sports
Interesting, I’m not invited to either of their weddings
Interesting. I know one actuary (Kiera O'Dwyer) from BC and she's switching to consulting 
Interesting. I wonder if there is a significant positive relationship between DVOA and LOS per drive
Interesting. I’m against it more than I’m for it for the reasons discussed above. But obviously I see the arguments in favor 
Interesting. Por que?
Interesting. So they used to bribe/market to the doctors, and now they cant, so they market to the patients
Interesting... I guess my question is, should I put money in now, or wait?
Interesting... I really don’t like those. Does anybody else like Andes?
Interesting... so that adds more weight to positions with high variance 
Interestingly Seahawks are #23, but that's prob because this is from 09-14 and they only became a big deal 3 years ago
Interestingly the last 2 seasons have seen a sharp rise in doing away with the conventional 1-5 lineup that goody just wrote
Intersectional progressives when they have to come to terms with that^

Iran
Iran also attacks civilian oil tankers, used Shia militias to attack Syrian villages, and kills dissenters and gay people, but potato potahto
Iran doing nothing. Russia doing nothing. Hezbollah doing nothing. Absolutely bananas.
Iran funds and arms terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East 
Iran is correct
Iran is still probably the top of the Middle East countries power rankings 
Iran is the only overwhelming majority Shia nation in the world. Iraq is like 50-60%. Lebanon is only 40%-ish but that's enough for a plurality. Azerbaijan and Bahrain I didn't know, had to look up 
Iran is unambiguously the baddies unless you’re bashar al Assad or Vladimir Putin
Iran shot down a US drone 
Iran was one of the most liberal countries because the US staged a coup to make it that way. The common people decided they'd rather have ultraconservative Islam, and overthrew the US backed shah 
Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine?
Iranian. Russia hasn't been accused of doing anything like that (yet) according to the FBI
Iranians who don’t die
Iraq
Iraq 2025 will be bulking szn. 1000 lb club is my stretch goal
Iraq is slightly more straight forward. Iraqi Govt vs ISIS vs Taliban/other terrorists. Iran is also supporting Shia militias in Anbar who basically comprise another terrorist group, just this one is Shia. 
Iraqis who don’t like Iran die
Ireland?
IRGC claiming it targeted and hit a “spy HQ”, no US facilities
Irish cuisine lives up to the hype as objectively terrible 
Irish dubliner is amazing. I know you've brought that up before in here
Iroh is Mr Bourque
IRON BOWL
Ironic that the grammar in this groupme is probably better than 99% of the internet
Ironic typo?
Ironically but not surprisingly, I am firmly in the most liberal quartile in the Air Force, probably more actually
Ironically Danny Dimes would be considered a hit here lmao
Ironically him and Aurilia are both now NBCSN Bay Area commentators 
ironically i literally just got an email asking for applications to cross train into pilot
Ironically I read fight club before seeing the movie 
Ironically if I had just done blow instead I would have passed the drug test
Ironically JT ended up being a beast lmao. But too little too late
Ironically obesity is considered a preexisting condition and therefore cannot be factored into ones insurance rate
Ironically she just bought liquid death fruity pebbles flavor
Ironically their core players were generally juice free. Jeter, Pettite, Posada, Mariano, D Wells, D Cone, Bernie Williams, Paul ONeill, Tim Raines, Daryl Strawberry...
Ironically this is exactly the opposite of the logic Kevin used about Hillary Swank 
Ironically this seems like a super frat tattoo
Ironically were one of the highly influential pundits calling for Warren to do the DNA test to shut Donald up. Lmao talk about a backfire
Ironically, also Houston but baseball
Ironically, as someone who's admittedly pretty damn right wing, I will have never voted for a Republican president.
Ironically, today is my 1 year military anniversary 
Irrelevant 
Irrelevant because it's impossible
Irrelevant, and I don't want you to root for me
Irrelevant, I'm shitting on LA
Irrespective of this “thing”, If I was a Jags fan I’d want him fired. He’s total trash, and it was evident before the season even started. Awful on field coaching. Lost the locker room already. Get him out.

Israel, Saudi Arabia, Panama
It (understandably) got lost in the content but i need to call out having a power rankings of your FRIEND’s hookups as psychotic behavior
It absolutely buries the chow hall food I’ve had for 6 months lol
It absolutely is different. You’re implying there is no option between “total withdrawal right now” and “kill everyone”
It actually be the ones you least expect 
It actually bothers me that the east coast doesn't support the McDonald's app yet. I loved that thing haha
It actually makes me sad that so much of saquons prime was wasted in NYG. He’s a HoF RB on half the teams in the NFL.
It actually took me like 10 minutes to remember mike Woodbury’s name lol
It all comes down to how good Taylor ends up being
It all depends on the insane black hole that is the immediate future of this conflict. If we go to war in a month, it’s difficult to say this was a good idea even though both sides can point to the other as who started it. But Soleimani is one of the biggest influences in Iranian regional power and has done so with a mix of Saddam Hussein esque brutality and Putin esque use of proxies. 
It also allows for a forum where all other candidates can shit on Trump and he won't be there to defend himself
It also blows for the unexpected bye week teams that their bye week is a week of intense practice, and not a real bye week
It also doesn’t hurt that he looks like... that...
It also highlights pass catchers in green when they’re wide open
It also prioritizes titties
It also provided a (relatively) harmless way for teenage boys to release their angst and anger. That’s why teenage depression was lowest for our generation
It also showed that the majority of the left and the country wants DACA but did not support shutting down the govt over it
It an interesting article that looks at some non-obvious statistics
It appears 4/5 of those are consensus, and not the $3 choice
It appears I missed a barn burner of a day. My catchup begins now
It appears Lamb will hold the lead. Back to back special election victories for the Democrats in heavy red territory
It appears to be exactly the same as it's always been, minus on field success
It be the ones you least suspezt
It better not be butthole altuve
It blows, but it's better than sports science 
It brings me great pleasure to announce that Drake London’s epic performance won me the matchup in all 3 fantasy leagues. Normally nobody would care, but like Gandalf and the Balrog, he staved off the suicide demons when they were at their most dangerous. The Man in the Arena fights another day
It brings me great pleasure to announce that Emyr has joined the best ball virgin club 
It came on in a bar last night and nobody I was with knew it
It can be tough to get those hands up on the high fastball
It can get super weird if they’re step siblings 
It can tell on you then you get put on probation 
It can/should be earned. Just like a man
It can’t I don’t think. It’s always a sabbath day
It can’t possibly be Troy smith can it?
It can't happen this weekend, but we will pick one in the near future!! 
It captures our style of speech so well
It certainly doesn't look good for Clinton 
It certainly will be the weirdest
It comes down to women and Latinos. So basically we’re fucked
It contrasts to the "give everybody everything and don't worry about sustainability or repercussions" principle, aka "The Venezuela"
It could probably have a pretty good idea what any of us would say in a given scenario
It could take off if it was a barrier
It creeps me out
It culminates when he says that he held a private party in Weehauken NJ that Chris Brown and Trey Songz attended personally. There are allegedly photos but for "private audiences only". The hate grows on askfm. A week later, he claims that boxer Miguel Cotto gave him a Lamborghini as a gift for being his friend... The ask fm mustve skyrocketed, but right around then goes AWOL again
It depends a lot more on the team location and the GM
It depends on the team cap and also player history. Like a single player can't get more than 25% of the team cap or something, but that rises to 30% if it's an extension with the dams team. Numbers probably off but that's the gist of it. And team cap is set by the league revenue 
It depends on what you’re using as your metric of utility. If the utility is winning the game, then a game has to have a winner and loser
It depends. Some things are plausible like the above. Some things (like ghost of Kiev unfortunately) not a shot in hell
It didn’t happen but it defacto became the broncos 
It didn’t move
It didn't win him the nomination, but its inconclusive whether or not it helped or hurt him. Also, he was campaigning to Republicans only. Hillary will be talking to the general electorate. 
It does add another complication to derivatives trading and auction budget trading that was implemented last year
It does and it doesn’t. But that graph, while interesting, has basically nothing to do with viewership as if one can’t be fans of multiple sports 
It does make me laugh that most Supermax NBA players are legit underpaid
It does not in fact work with Jets fans
It doesn’t count if the victims are Irish
It doesn’t matter tho because delegates are proportional, first place doesn’t matter like a general 
It doesn’t matter. The Emotions aren’t insignificant 
It doesn't matter, "the guy" is still the guy no matter what order he's in
It economically makes the most sense. But even the coldest hearted conservative bastards can see how it’s not societally equitable 
It even matches the names and the shorts color for you
It feels good to call a breakout tho
It feels like there’s been a flag on 80% of these plays 
It feels so fake. But the fact that all these popped up with the exact same format, by only super popular accounts only, at the same time, seems too coordinated to be fake
It felt extra good when i hit a good drive off the first tee
It finally is
It gets a lot darker and a lot deeper in a big mystery/conspiracy. I will say I was sorta disappointed that much of the mystery is not revealed
It gets drier air? So the balls could be harder? That might only work with baseball
It goes down in history as the last play of Goody's fantasy football career
It goes from 1/2 to 2/3
It goes Reggie, jayz, 2pac and biggie...
It happened
It happened again lol
It happens a decent amount
It has a big cult following on Reddit haha
It has a buckle on it lmao
It has a track man tho
It has been 2QB for years. If anything Marcus should have expected that
It has been entertaining watching her flail 
It has benefitted me greatly many times
It has everything to do with trading $30
It has nothing to do with the cab or company or passengers or anything 
It hasn't really been used since like the colonial period though 
It helps me if Pete voters go to Biden (or Bernie lol) disproportionately. It helps you if Pete voters are distributed equally amongst the non-Bernie candidates. I’d say the former is more likely, especially with SC results. 
It honestly looks terrible
It hurts my ears when I read it
It improves the odds of getting the call right so I’m for it 
It insists upon itself 
It is a Confucian thing that you should keep your head down and do your duty. Think so in Japan too.
It is a legit grievance
It is a very fine line that separates genius and madness
It is a very relevant topic tho. It’s becoming another rallying cry of the young left, but we’ve already seen the rural lower income parts of the country swing hard right over the past 10 years. So yeah much like the extremely unpopular “defund the police” mantra, it would not seem to be a good strategy for the Dems to pursue
It is an interesting situation in that the top 1% of americans pay for 40% of federal income taxes, and the top 10% pay 70% of them.  Meanwhile 5% of americans incur 50% of healthcare costs.
It is and will be until putin is gone
It is comical how much of a pathetic trainwreck he’s been and continues to be
It is comical tho
It is finished. Zero bumpable songs. Some kinda nice piano riffs and choir choruses but like something you’d be impressed with from a church performance, not an album from the biggest music star of the generation
It is for me
It is funny that the Cavs trading IT gave the Lakers cap space to sign Lebron 
It is hilariously ironic that the year we put no money on survivor pool, becker wins 
It is hysterical that the state doing best with vaccines so far is... West Fucking Virginia
It is hysterical that the whole playoff was made to eliminate this possibility and it still happened
It is ironic that the women actually doing something to change the wage gap are the engineering and comp sci majors, but the ones bitching about it are the gender studies majors. 
It is known is Dothraki 
It is objectively true that murders have skyrocketed nationwide
It is possible through a contested convention (if he remains in the race). But I have no idea how those things work, so no real insight here
It is pretty funny that Byron Leftwich to Jags looked like a slam dunk lock until he removed himself from consideration 
It is something that even is our incomes rise, our consumption habits don’t really change 
It is still pretty absurd that iguodala won finals MVP for holding Lebron to 25 a game
It is targeting tho… they shouldn’t call it but it is
It is the first indictments (and one plea bargain) of the Russian election meddling that trump has been calling a phony witch hunt
It is the original fantasy sport 
It is totally possible tho
It is usually 1 week before draft, but that's today which is unfair, so let's call it Tuesday. That gives 3 days (incl draft day)
It is well documented he requested his tweets to be hardcoded to be at the top of everyone’s feed, specifically after the Super Bowl when Biden’s Super Bowl tweet got 10x more likes than his 
It is with great sadness to report Becker outplayed me this weekend
It is, but this is the hell we hath created, and now we must live in it
It is, but we're also for a unified Iraq (anti Kurdish independence, at least at this moment). And we've given a shit ton of tanks, humvees, weapons, and training to the Iraqi govt over the past decade. They were who we were supporting post saddam and even now 
It is. States have different minimum wages, and so do different cities like Seattle
It is. We have our own laws and everything. 
It just dawned on me that Penn St doesn’t have a true rival 
It just makes sense
It just pains me to watch marcus’ natural athletic talent losing the battle to Ben and Jerry’s 
It literally caused goody to quit fantasy forever
It literally says that they hate atheists, gays, Christians, etc and they deserve to die. And it even mocks Americans who say that they're not real Muslims and is afraid of offending anyone and not being politically correct. And the third text picture even says that those who understand that this terrorism is true Islam are "painted as a social fringe", and most people are naively part of the "Islam is a peaceful religion crowd". This is fucking ISIS stating their goals very clearly and laughing at the liberal SJW idiots who say terrorism has no religion. 
It looked genius for the first drive for a TD but then a stupid INT makes you go hmm
It looked that way but now that crypto has imploded NFTs are the only sure fire store of value
It looks fucking hard. Like jumping rope for 30 minutes and having crazy ab workouts
It looks like a cerebral cortex
It looks like a combination of bandaids and hair that you’d pull out of a public pool drain
It looks like a vape battery 
It looks like it’s just macaroni and meat sauce 
It looks too crazy to be real
It looks way better idc
It made me smile
It makes for a great pic tho
It makes me feel better than the 538 crew all roast Nate Silver every time Rubio comes up hahaha
It makes me happy that tiger woods helped finance your ring
It makes me happy to hear both of those things 
It makes sense though, Donny doesn't wanna walk around and use up that human life battery any more than he needs to, or he'll die faster
It may be inadvertent but it is cheating nonetheless and unlike the patriots I cannot live with this guilt
It may be the only way to get the Tennis Ball of Justice to be delivered in mid winter to maximize the pain
It may have been a week or two after. It was as soon as I was eliminated
It means I get called Lieutenant Kelleher for the first time
it means we’re worse than the chantiqueers
It means you pop on Facebook 
It means your transideological. Fortunately I'll let you use the same bathroom as me
It might actually be terrible if I win. Because I’d feel forced to bequeath the day off to one of my troops…
It might be a account he pays to comment on his shit
It might be tough to tell spread from moneyline tho
It might be weird taking the metro in my OCPs lol
It might be. I have no concept of barber prices in the past 5 years
It might change when they start paying the players 
It might not work but it’s obvious to me why it’s being done
It must include lemon pepper wings
It needs to be brought up 
It never adds anything at all
It never fails to boggle my mind how NIL, transfer portal, and death of Pac12 all happened within 2 years. We will never know what effects they could have each had independently 
It never made sense for the Niners to draft a QB anyway, so that's why I can believe the bears thought someone else would trade up
It often takes a preseason season ending injury to really tell
It pains me to admit but I’m gonna hit ground balls today unless we’re up big
It pains me to say but Caitlin is not good on defense. Stand and watch 
It pains me to say that my book this year is not looking great 
it reads bottom to top
It really takes the wind out of the sails when you call somebody’s bet stupid but are unwilling to take the other side, even for $10
It reminds me of that night when he debuted it and got totally flambéed 
It says I hit a PW 185
It says pick 3 but that’s not enough
It seemed crazy not to include an LA team but they didn’t exist for a while
It seems like a “this makes too much sense, we can get a better deal” situation for both parties
It should be baked into the data if defenses in the playoffs are actually better. Otherwise you’d have to take a subset of defenses with an improved DVOA/EPA (or some other metric of your choice), which I think is too much finger on the scale
It should be James holzhauer 
It should be official now but I guess it’s more official then 
It should go without saying that this was for a girl 
It shouldn't, but no way to separate the points against I guess
It shows doctors are greedy assholes
It slipped out of his hand. I watched it in slomo like 20 times 
It sounded like a sea shanty to me
It sounded so familiar and then was so obvious at 4
It sounds cultury?
It sounds like a dumbass Navy game that is supposed to teach leadership but just sucks to play. We have “Icarus” in the Air Force. 
It sounds like he bought a bunch of produced tracks and half-ass sang over them
It sounds like something the barely informed fans would say. So yeah sports radio makes sense
It sounds like the music for an epic Zelda cutscene
It sounds like you're rolling a fat joint with toilet paper
It sounds more exciting for sure and fixes a real problem. If the players like it then I say go for it. Sounds like something that could be trialed in the D league
It stands for Regulatory Eligible trade on a Legacy Margin Agreement. Thrilling I know
It started like 30-10 
It still has to pass the senate, which is going to be more difficult. But you wouldn't know that from the champagne popping that Trump is doing right now
It still hits decent and is prob fixable 
It sucks that Pitt is basically what BC aspires to be
It tastes like a Eucharist wafer. It’s plain. 
It the second tab of the same spreadsheet, which is also in the ESPN league home page
It took 3 years but I finally got COVID
It took like 48 hours to go from a hippie paradise to a third world war zone
It took longer for Keenan Allen to return from a hammy than Brian Robinson to return from his gunshot wound
It took me a week to admit that
It totally depends on setting, number of people, and skill of players
It truly is Rory vs the mental midget allegations today
It uses the same tune, yes
It varies. Basketball either has categories or points. Categories is like Pts, Rebounds, FG% etc. whoever wins more categories wins the matchup. Or each action has a point value, and it's same as football. Baseball is same way, except it's almost always categories 
It warms my heart to see Avatar as the #5 most watched show
It was "random with tweaking" if I remember correctly
It was $40 then used to balance draft $
It was 1.5 in like 11:15. But I ran like 9:35 in March 2019 so that’s prob about as good as it’s gonna get
It was 2012-2013
It was 24B. How’d that bar be handed over to the pink side?
it was 53-45 D in 2015 under obama
It was a 50-50 tossup by every predictive model and Handel is winning by 6. Trump only won by 1.5, and polls had Ossoff ahead by 1-2 for the past week or so. It's not "surprising" but it is significantly worst than the Dems would've hoped for.
It was a bit off in this prerecorded import https://v.groupme.com/9980661/2020-07-07T02:07:15Z/6fde7a92.320x568r.mp4
It was a bullshit DPI call
It was a commentary on your prescience, but since you referred to the Democrats as “we”, MSNBC was the obvious choice of network
It was a decent story but there was just so much glaringly wrong that 14 year old me was like “yeah fucking right”
It was a first time experience for me
It was a gag and spit up, not a full blown puke
It was a glitch in Halo 2 that players loved so much it just became part of the game. It was removed from halo 3.
It was a good day on r/NBA
It was a good movie but like for real?
it was a great season by BC. won every game we shouldve (minus UVA where we were missing Jurk and Bailey, and were more than competitive in games we were supposed to be blown out
It was a harder question too!
It was a hellfire but a standard explosive warhead, not a blade warhead 
it was a pioneer of the pop-country wave
It was a play action. I buy the call 
It was a Pulse joke, not a 9/11 joke
It was a reference...
It was a tough decision. Went with the safer pick
It was AB for Thielen, who has a keeper value of $21 this season IIRC
It was actually "Are you impressed?"
It was actually really tough lol
It was actually received quite well
It was actually the oil changes that were "accidental", since that actually can affect the match haha
It was all downhill from here
It was also from @Fantasy Baseball Champion, Esq. 
It was also on that bus ride that I discovered one full bladder = approx 2.3 cans worth of pee
It was always PPV, basically following WWE's established biz model. I believe the first free UFC event was TUF1 finale?
It was Amex lol
It was an above expectations season 
It was an all time memorable 6 holes that’s for sure
it was an incredible goody autism moment
It was at Gameday and I brought my “we want the bills sign” which as a bills fan she disliked. Then after the 3rd or so time she vocalized her displeasure I said “you’ve used up your chirps” or something along those lines. And she said “chirp” was sexist. Fortunately Jackie was right there to say “no it’s not,” saving me from a mega lecture.
It was awesome it's just weird that she was 20. And also really really tall.
It was basically the wildest thing I’ve ever experienced. We flew an air interdiction mission, which meant a lot of altitude changing and S maneuvers. Got up to 5.6 Gs, which I did ok through since I was practicing my muscle tension and my breathing for the previous day. But coming out of the high G maneuvers made me feel nauseous as hell, and negative Gs can go fuck themselves. Barrel rolls are not that bad. The most brutal was the slice back, where you bank 135 degrees then pull a 180 as fast as possible 
It was because of the eagles of the war path chant at marcus wedding
It was bound to happen
It was bouye and sure it wasn’t perfect but he was step for step and his timing on the disruption was perfect
It was Colt McCoy vs Crabtree. Just back and forth lead changes all game, and Crabtree had a ridiculous game winning catch with time expiring. 
It was controversial 
It was cool until he jump kicked mcgregors corner like a lunatic
It was definitely a controversial fine, but it happened and I think Pop doesn't regret it at all 
It was definitely super impressive
It was definitely touristy
It was early corona. We were so young and innocent. 
It was either that or that it was in such high demand that you didn’t wanna waste a cover letter
It was either your dad or Kristen’s dad
It was far more complicated than last year so there might be errors. Would appreciate some QC
It was for his own safety. Didn't want to lose him in the snow
It was funny!
It was great our teacher was all about it
It was hilarious mmkay 
It was his first week at BC
It was in fact easy
It was in fact funny for like 24 hours
It was in response to bellinger saying he lost respect for all the Astros and that they stole the World Series
It was incomplete but the fact that there’s no review is BS
It was interesting tho how they chose to portray McFarland as like a big vision gone wrong kinda guy, and not a fucking fraudster. Until the end that is
It was Joe
It was junior year IIRC
It was just a joke guys
It was just boys being boys 
It was just on Jeopardy lol
It was like $50 for $5 worth of cheap snacks
It was like 90% black kids
It was made a few months ago. Back when the polls were within 4
It was me
It was more of a coaching problem than anything else, IMO. Which I think is generally true across the NFL
It was more of a song vibes based pick
It was not a good shot but it was not a shank
It was not in fact true
It was not the tips but it was not the ladies tees
It was Pats by 1
It was posted due to it’s ridiculousness, but shoutout to the fuckholes for taking it super literal, except the jokemaster of course
It was pre-expansion I think
It was pretty funny
It was pretty mediocre IMO. 8/10 songs sounded like carbon stock photo punk-metal songs. Catching fire and Never There were the only unique ones for me
It was ridiculous
It was right after he came out so it was relevant at the time
It was shocking because it was on stage at the Oscar’s. Otherwise I don’t think it was a big deal. 
It was so effective that Derek Fisher could even transition sports 
It was so perfext the announcers were like “this drive could determine his career” 
It was some kind of ice cream, and probably some unique vermonty one, and I’ve had blueberry lavender ice cream which fit that bill
It was sometime around October / November 2012
It was super in your face at Accenture and at GS too. But the most outrageous stuff is definitely online
IT was the definition of a mediocre player until the 2 years on the Cs when he was the focal point of the offense. It’s safe to say that’s as good as he can possibly be, and it’s clearly all star good. But in every other situation, he’s been totally mediocre 
It was the front page article too. It was exhausting and pointless
It was the girl from San Andreas
It was the jooooooos
It was the lunch equivalent of a wedding
It was the redskins, not the Cowboys. But not surprised it was a garbage NFC East worst division in football with the worst fans and front offices 
It was tiny
It was touch rim
It was. Thanks for the follow up Jeff, it let's me know you care
It wasn’t a grand robbery of all time but idk how 2 of 3 judges could give round 3 to volkanovski 
It wasn’t an instant classic but it’s as good as you can ask for
It wasn’t even a commanding officer. It was some dumbass captain 
It wasn’t exactly this design but pretty close
It wasn’t funny or clever enough 
It wasn’t impeachment, it was doesn’t finish the term
It wasn’t my fault Josh Hamilton was half drunk while ranting for 45 minutes 
It wasn’t that good of a joke to go out on my shield for
It wasn't
it will almost certainly be mandatory for everyone eventually, but i guess with the limited current supply and simulatenously the ability to gain skeptics' confidence over the months of watching their peers take it, they made the choice to not make it mandatory immediately
It will be more fun with them no matter what
It will be useful anyway. My prelim bout is against goodwin
It will change when the players start getting paid, and whichever school has the richest diehard fans will dominate
It will do it for you
It will likely give the dynasty schools like a better chance at winning it all actually since they’re more able to play at a high level for 2/3 games than a UCF
It worked for the rams this year. But in general I think the NFL is more unpredictable and teams get good/bad way faster than in the NBA
It works though because it’s after he’s stuck his pink thing in the shellder
It works well for cross referencing overlapping tables of data by using join logic. Based on your 2 sentence description it seems like access is exactly what you want
It would actually be so funny if he did and they immediately won the Super Bowl. Would be exactly Brady, again. 
It would also increase tax revenue for the city with all the additional DUIs. Win-win
It would be 2 plus the one they’re already scheduled right?
It would be a hell of a fight. Before Alvarez, RDA had been on a tear over "better strikers" like Cerrone and Pettis
It would be a scene from Gran Torino
It would be a very different dynamic. I just think the situations parallels are similar and it’s been sitting front of mind for me
It would be better than the groups of girls who stay and talk for 4 hours and buy 2 rounds
It would be cool if Aiyuk learned through this process that maybe he’s not a lock for $40 million guaranteed, and also teams won’t trade a first to give them the right to pay him that. And so he stays with the Niners on a fair deal. 
It would be cool if candy was transferable by type
It would be DeLOLme actually
It would be entertaining even if nobody listened to it
It would be funny if someone was stuck taking the SAT for like 5 years straight 
It would be insane to have him outside top 5. He’s more top 1 than he is 6-10
It would be large in part due to Kuechly, so that tempers my rage a weensie bit
It would be legendary if he was like “I’ll give you a birthday special 25% off my fitness program PDF”
It would be like an NFL game being decided by pinning a punt within the 10
It would be like Babe Ruth coming back and getting struck out in AAA
It would be like changing from Electoral College to popular vote after the results are in
It would be like saying “oh Nirvana is just generic grunge”
It would be only fitting that my former co GM sends his old team to the Posa with his newfound inheritance 
It would be stupid to at least. Market share is worth the temporary loss
It would depend a lot on the strategy the team was building. Id say it would have to be like Von Miller or JJ Watt or someone, since a strong front line is just so important to so many aspects of defense. 
It would have been a terrible non call
It would help if the president wasn’t senile
It would mean the end of the Republican Party as we know it for sure. Which I actually think might be a good thing long term - isolate the extremists and create a more moderate right, which would then take people from the moderate left. However it would also mean Hillary becomes POTUS which might ruin the world. 
It would not change my calculus
It would probably work, but the Dems have an identity crisis right now. The Bernie wing of the party is really stubborn about having a progressive, and the Dems aren't handling it well 
It would require a lot of research and yes I 100% agree it would need to be at the community level. But you can't dismiss the whole concept because you don't like it, especially when it applies to every other market in the history of the world
IT*
It’s $10 except John who’s just playing for fun. The decision is final. Fuck you all. 
It’s $22
It’s 1000% Cora, according to the report. Then continued by the team and players after Cora left 
It’s 2:40 am here. My shifts about to start 😞
It’s 2000 steps per mile. So apparently goody walks 15-25 miles a day.
It’s 2019 and girls can get boners now so I guess it makes sense
It’s 25 yards. I’ve seen becker throw a ball 25 yards, so he better be able to kick it that far
It’s 3 separate teams, 20 years each
It’s 3:30, but it’s just such a classic Scorsese mob film and it’s done pretty much perfectly 
It’s 8 hours. And @Skimmer is equally as versed 
It’s a 70 year conflict. 70 year conflicts tend to have some nuance to them, despite what Erin might post 
It’s a badge of honor to be the only person in the world who can get Becker to root for Marcus 
It’s a classic meme
It’s a completely meaningless term. Emotional abuse could literally be anything that you don’t like
It’s a dope name tho 
It’s a fair question on whether to attempt to prevent people from being fat or alcoholics or smokers, especially in relation to the question on paying for public healthcare
It’s a fucking joke that these taxes can be levied executively under the guise of national security
It’s a gain for the government and winner and equivalent loss for the losers
It’s a galaxy brain move. Be so bad at passing and have such bad receivers that your opponents play man every snap, so their backs are always turned, so you can scramble for 15 yards every play 
It’s a good pick
it’s a Hanukkah song but it bops 
It’s a laughable attempt relative to all other coups in history but I think it fits the definition more so than not
It’s a legit consideration. But I think we all agree there’s a difference between “elite in 2024” vs “who would you take first to build a franchise”
It’s a lindor quote to me
It’s a line from top gun. Or close to it. 
It’s a nice looking pad
It’s a progressive proposal so they’re against it. I was pointing out that it’s largely counter to the progressive agenda. Separately, it’s worth noting that Fox News has been very Bernie friendly over the past several months. 
It’s a real shame that 90% of women who sleep with me aren’t wife material
It’s a rotating position, Like I was flight leader last week. There are a bunch of positions that they’re trying to emulate a real squadron. So the Wing Commander is the top student position every week. 
It’s a sentence that would fit in a fast and furious movie 
It’s a shame that the success of analytics has made baseball more boring, 
It’s a sign, the Japanese horse got this. Put it all on Crown Pride
It’s a similar question with ranking basketball players. Those last guys you mentioned were beasts for their time but wouldn’t hold a candle to Brees. I don’t think Brees is much better than the top 1/3 newest generation of QBs in the game he helped create
It’s a stretch but I kinda dig it
It’s a surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, like todays RQ-4s or U-2s 
It’s a tanking move. I also would’ve approved it 100% if it was anybody else and y’all know that
It’s a tennis ball
It’s a tossup here, I prob would have punted it too (safer, more conventional) but I respect the balls. Especially as Chan said, the falcons should bet on their offense, not their defense 
It’s a word that you have to know exactly what it means to even be aware of its existence 
It’s about time for our politicians to focus on effort over good politics
It’s absolutely domestic terrorism
It’s absolutely massive. Like 30 miles across. It has everything. Went to the Grand Canyon last weekend and camped for 1 night in 28 degree weather (opted for a hotel the second night). I’ve spent a weekend downtown and at the Glendale mall, which are both very nice but not nearly as crowded and lively as Boston or NYC. Haven’t been East of downtown. 
It’s absolutely mind boggling that the NFL is now DECREASING testing with the cases spiking around the country/world. I know it’s not surprising that they are only ever 1000% about the money but the blatant middle finger to their alleged health and safety priorities is still a bucket of cold water 
It’s absolutely more work than football. But still not that hard
It’s actually “doncic”
It’s actually 4 ranks
It’s actually a detailed and complex article after you get past the quiz part, but if you’re used to buzzfeed then yay you got gryffindor 
It’s actually amazing how much Rodgers has tanked his brand in the past 3 years
It’s actually amazing that PFT built himself up from pre-social media Barstool MMQB writer to being on college game day 
It’s actually an incredible take. The USSR was bad, but because it exploited the poor Russians to enrich the greedy undeserving minorities.
It’s actually called the Triihard League
It’s actually funny that many of these guys wrestle in the Olympics and world championships, then go back to NCAA lol 
It’s actually pretty cool that Caitlin Clark is single-handedly making women’s basketball a sport that people actually want to watch 
It’s actually set up for a huge 2 months when people pokemon go to the polls
It’s actually spelled Türkiye now
It’s actually the J in SJW, now how about that there sonny?
It’s actually Woof
It’s adjustable based on where you are stationed. I’m getting a housing rate of $1000 in Alamogordo. $2600 in DC.
It’s all about the salary:responsibility ratio
It’s all fun and games until Angela yells out “oh Josh!”
It’s almost comical seeing young athletic Charles Barkley flying around the court 
It’s also a very different question if it’s “who might be the first one to cross the picket line”
It’s also by far the most individual sport
It’s also frigid rain here so I had to cancel my storming plans
It’s also funny because the NCAAF is super un woke because the SEC would never 
It’s also funny to me that Stetson Bennett might be a back to back NCAA champ but also will probably go undrafted and unsigned
It’s also funny to me that the B-21 has had a pretty high profile rollout while the RQ-180 has probably been operational for years but still hasn’t officially been acknowledged by the Air Force, despite being literally in an AF commercial 
It’s also funny to me that the lightweights are the weight classes where the blue bloods don’t dominate. I honestly think it’s because they don’t approach their athleticism peak until they’re like freshmen/sophomore year of college, so they’re not as easy to identify as studs in high school 
It’s also hilarious that Chauncey Billups is also in trouble for gambling, UNRELATED to the Rozier trouble lmfao
It’s also ironic because all sensitivity training stresses how you aren’t supposed to treat anyone any differently, as joes snap reminded me
It’s also kinda ironic because I’m one of the biggest pro-Israel shills I know
It’s also part of the reason they’re going down the tubes. Sure their cost of production is low but great that just means they’re sinking more slowly
It’s also possible that a lot of people dislike trump but hate the Democrats more, and emyr might be right that they’re just losers
It’s also possible the early reaching out to the Bernie folks will simply draw backlash that she’s a neoliberal cuck in the pockets of the banks or whatever
It’s also potentially an effective strategy to neuter trump. He can’t (effectively) claim to be a winner or victim
It’s also tough to find someone who wants to do it
It’s also usually to win money
It’s also why the US has been unable to supply Ukraine with effective medium-long range SAMs. We don’t have them, because our doctrine is to keep the skies clear with our own aircraft. 
It’s always the falcons for me
It’s amazing the pats went 12-4 with that roster 
It’s amazing tho that archaeologists are pretty confident that dinosaurs were more like birds than lizards, and the world was collectively like “yeah I don’t care that’s lame as hell”
It’s an actual MRI
It’s an Afrocentric clothing company, and that’s not my screenshot 
It’s an AI language model, aka an extremely high quality chat bot
It’s an app?
It’s an incomplete question. I appreciate a great rack more than a great ass, likely due to rarity. But if I had to choose one without the other, gimme the 🍑. 
It’s an interesting strategy, but considering the Dem nominee pool is gonna be 50 deep, not necessarily a bad one
It’s an OG cut. Gotta be a true fan to know the deep tracks
It’s analogous to the gasson hall of the hospital 
It’s annoying but don’t hate on BC for it because literally every single college worth it’s salt does this
It’s appropriate that neither of these teams have easy LOL puns because neither deserves it
It’s at least top 3
It’s Aung San Suu Kyi
It’s babe Ruth swinging a hurling bat lmao
It’s bad and we should eminent domain that shit
It’s basically a decision tree right 
It’s basically saving private Ryan in the halo universe 
It’s basically the FIFA super league 
It’s been 3 years since his last participation in here
It’s been a long hike 
It’s been established ad nauseum that republicans are huge hypocrites. But this debt cancelation is unquestionably a wealth transfer to the upper income echelons of america, which is obviously counter to the Dems (formerly?) stated goals
It’s been really nice if it’s not raining
It’s been said before and it will be said again. But not having Caleb as the FLB was a travesty
It’s been too quiet on the tankie front recently 
It’s been well established that the FH hate the troops 
It’s berth. And is the news that Marcus is leaving the league?
It’s better than being not reviewable. Yeah there can be controversy but it’s not like there wasn’t any before
It’s buns
It’s by definition not more objective but I think it’s the better way of having the best teams get in as well as giving a shot to the non P5s
It’s called Lahinch in West Ireland. Near the cliffs of Moher. Super linksy, and absurdly narrow fairways
It’s cam newton 
It’s cause she’s a euro
It’s certainly debatable. But the main reason I think it’s a negative are that a lot of Catholic Latinos who normally vote democrat wouldn’t vote for him
It’s certainly more iconic than Bonesaw
It’s certainly something tho that madden players were years ahead of the curve on lots of real life football decisions 
It’s changing college sports at a fundamental level (ie eliminates them completely). I haven’t yet heard a single argument that allows athletes to get paid without college sports at a fundamental level. 
It’s classic inept Dems that they know they’ve needed to find a young star since Obama hit second term (who they straight lucked into) and the closest they got was buttigieg
It’s classified
It’s close, but it’s true
It’s coach Carter
It’s coming it’s coming alright. Now what kind of pizzas do you want?
It’s crazy to me that in healthcare, extremely high volume can lead to mega losses
It’s Cronenberg John
It’s Dan Carlin from hardcore history on the capitol insurrection
It’s decent but wayyy overhyped
It’s decent so far
It’s Donald J Trump. Can’t you tell by the blue check?
It’s draft + $10. Or if higher, Waiver add for yourself 
It’s easily navigable from there. But you have to turn off adblock 
It’s easy (and free) if you’re just filling out the 1040 EZ and taking the standard deduction. However you might not be doing that since you bought a condo and are probably writing that off. 
It’s either 2 or 3
It’s either under 40 or under 50. Only goes by 10 yard increments
It’s fair
It’s far too early to tell. As mentioned in my last series of posts, the X factor is how sustainable this war is for Russia (and Ukraine but let’s focus on Russia), both militarily and domestically. If Russia is willing and able to withstand the economic suffering, then I’d say the sanctions did not accomplish their goals, even if they are “effective”. 
It’s freshman IR101 levels of understanding. Basically, Russia is trying to destroy Ukraine in totality, and Elon is pulling a “can’t we all just get along”
It’s fucking over
It’s fucking stupid. It’s like less fun dodgeball. The goal is to destroy targets (cones). There are roles of air to air, surface to air, air to surface, and munitions reloaders. It is cool in theory but then half the people can’t throw a ball for the life of them so it sucks.  
It’s funnier when you preface every trump tweet with: “And next we have Don from queens, Don you’re on the air” 
It’s funny
It’s funny because this can apply to trump or Biden lmao
It’s funny how a 99% true positive rate (or whatever it is) seems incredible until you run 1000 tests a day, and therefore expect 10 false positives 
It’s funny how in serving, we refer to customers with zero regard for PCness. “Who’s this drink for?” “Table 42, the fat guy/old lady/etc”
It’s funny how the guys who can lean into their corniness are immediately loved 
It’s funny to me that Kevon Looney is about equally as good as Tristan Thompson 
It’s funny watching the parsing of what “star” and “known to the casual fan” means. Is Pittman the former? Is Mo Alie Cox the latter?
It’s giving Urban Meyer Jags vibes
It’s gonna be $450+ MM
It’s gonna be a pain to get to JBAB no matter what
It’s gonna be Bryce Young
It’s gonna be close. But if you’re Biden, you’re underperforming vs where you wanted to be
It’s gonna be fields 
It’s gonna be interesting to see the prioritization of vaccines among healthy people vs people with self-inflicted health issues (eg obesity, diabetes, etc)
It’s gonna be packed in there lol
It’s gonna be really shitty when the cause of the blood clots is some other unrelated medicine women are taking
It’s gonna be so funny when Martin has 2 TDs today
It’s gonna take some tact, but I’d lean toward billing the hours. You get closer to meeting your goal, and you get paid more. You’re also protected legally if they try to cut you because of that, at least technically you are
It’s Gorbin Time
It’s got the rugged charm of a working man who would absolutely know how to run a farm 
It’s gotta be anesto
It’s gotta be slater
It’s gotta be the teamster crew, which has zero overlap with our coastal elite circle
It’s Halo 3 or MW2 for me
It’s happening 
It’s hard enough defending a 4.4 WR, if you don’t turn your head and get lucky, so be it 
It’s hilarious that 3 people in the quarantine list were in the Good Vibrations video 
It’s honestly farcical
It’s honestly incredible how the Pats are among the least individualistic cultures in the NFL but winning literally cures all
It’s honestly incredible that he’s on his 5th short contract and it just keeps working out for him
It’s honestly kinda sad that lebron and Steph are in their final years. We’ve been gifted with them having an all time sports rivalry for basically our entire lives
It’s honestly so fucking classic that republicans who have railed against masks and social distancing are all catching corona from the super spreader event which was ACB’s nomination ceremony
It’s how some girl got added to the exclusive Joe Bourque hate list so it’s amazing by that alone
It’s Hues fault
It’s hysterical that just ~10 years ago ESPN used to be Disneys golden goose and now it’s a giant liability 
It’s hysterical that this is the one crisis that’s legit not his fault and his reaction is to say it’s just no big deal
It’s important to not have “fuckhole” in the push notification when it tells you Ass Ketchum and The Big Dick Bandit sent a message
It’s important to take a stand, as long as it doesn’t hurt the bottom line. 
It’s impossible to recapture the zeitgeist (@intelligentsia) of the time
It’s impressive Pats went 12-4 with their offense last year
It’s in 7/4 !
It’s in Spanish because FIFA is a Brazilian organization
It’s in the gordo so yes by default
It’s incredible cam can come back from these injuries and still have the confidence to be the same rush heavy QB that made him great
It’s incredible how much mahones has become hateable because of them. My neighbor who knows nothing about football knows about his brother and wife
It’s incredible that in just a few short months, one FH is gonna be a rent slave to another FH
It’s incredible that people were talking about banning the brotherly shove and it turns out no other teams can repeatedly pull it off 
It’s incredibly hypocritical. His entire schtick is that the system is corrupt and he is coming to overturn it, but in the meantime, he’s happy being one of those very people he chides.
It’s indisputable that having a QB who is a liability is a bad idea
It’s interesting because Americans who travel are rarely if ever that stereotypical hatable type
It’s interesting that the righty is the predicts the most blue and the lefty predicts the most red 🤔 
It’s interesting to me you went with attempts, receptions, and TDs where I went with yards 
It’s ironic that after all these years, overhyped Swiss Army knife player cordarelle patterson is finally actually an effective Swiss Army knife player 
It’s ironic that they’re doing from captain to lieutenant hehehe
It’s Jags for me
It’s just asking me for my phone number so they can send a “security request” and click a link 
It’s just Foxtrot Hotels
It’s just literally all coasts and the cowboys bears and packers
It’s just sad
It’s just so creative relative to the past 15 years 
It’s just so disgusting
It’s just we don’t lose aircraft very often let alone publicly release video of it so it’s unique in that regard
It’s just with the driver tho. Irons, including 4h, are fine
It’s just written like a parody of the Neiman marxists 
It’s kind of a “throw em in there and forget about them” kinda deal by design
It’s kind of amazing that Burrow has escaped pretty much all criticism (mostly) because of one SB run
It’s kinda crazy the senate will be decided by 2 Georgia run offs. A historically red state that looks like it’s tipping for Biden. But when the folks have a chance to vote again knowing that they will decide the senate, I expect the red roots will come back stronger. 
It’s kinda dark
It’s legit sad that otherwise smart people are so vulnerable to hostile information operations 
It’s less fun, every team is stacked, 10 is really the minimum number to have a legit league IMO, 12 is optimal
"It’s like 19 or something. Biggest names are:

Biden (not actually running yet)
Bernie
Beto
Kamala Harris
Elizabeth Warren
Buttigieg
Cory Booker
"
It’s like 40 people. I’m gonna do the best I can to just win. Looks like butthole duke is going all the way
It’s like a cross between crocs and vans
It’s like a few weeks before the BC Reunion so it makes it unlikely I’m gonna go to that unfortunately 
It’s like a fried egg on a burger. Used to be artsy and different. Now it’s everywhere because people were like yeah that’s good as hell
It’s like diagon alley, but baaaaaaaad
It’s like every 15 years, somebody invents a new idea for finance without regulation, then it completely collapses and people rediscover why regulation was there in the first place 
It’s like having fire herb with a plastic crackpipe 
It’s like he’s never red a post in hear 
It’s like if one of the top QBs in the league was a rookie
It’s like if the Astros were like “we fully support harsher punishments for cheaters, starting in 2020”
It’s like lemon peppering but for betting
It’s like Rap God spread out over a whole album 
It’s like reality TV, you know what your signing up for, don’t get pissy that people laugh at you crying
It’s like the opposite of the Bud Light marketing story
It’s like the warriors 73 win season, except if they got swept in the first round of the playoffs 
It’s like the whole thing is a farce to him. He just laughs maniacally at the murder details and while recalling their fights and also appears to be coked out
It’s like they were fully committed to dumping salaries, and didn’t look that hard to get a bigger return
It’s literally “get your best ball carrier the ball in space”
It’s literally “I have this player, please tell me why he’s a top 5 option rest of season”
It’s literally a bunch of high schoolers who stumbled upon Anesto and can’t believe he’s a real person 
It’s literally just what it sounds like. All QB average say 80% completion pct on throws 6 yards downfield, and 50% on 15 yards, and 30% on 40 yards, etc. CPOE is a QB vs that league average QB
It’s literally more of a surprise if they lose a game than if they go undefeated
It’s literally the biggest cultural appropriation of all time lmao 
It’s literally the soccer Super League but done more slowly and tactfully to withstand the criticism 
It’s little league. Youre there to hit the ball.
It’s lonely at the top
It’s mainstream/catchy but also clever enough that I can see you rapping it in the car
It’s mfn bo time
It’s mielvin gurdun 
It’s mind boggling 
It’s more “time to reap what you sowed when you unleashed trump” hilarity in the GOP
It’s more like a daycare but I’ll take your description too on this fine Veterans Day 
It’s more like stealing a soda, then getting mad that somebody else stole a whole 6 pack of sodas
It’s more possible to have issues that are not your fault and require immediate care
It’s my new finna 
It’s Nick and Marcus. The furthest left/right people in the group.
It’s no Benchwarmers
It’s not
It’s not a “ridiculous thing” at all. It’s a highly cerebral and stat driven contest of minds. You have to blend advanced statistics with the eye test at the optimal level.  
It’s not a bad idea, but it’s mostly posturing IMO. Assad has killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians and we don’t care except that he has to slaughter with conventional weapons only. That’s a bit ridiculous. I’m not against the strikes per se but it’s way more headlines than substance 
It’s not a fucking bachelor show groupme jesus christ 
It’s not a matter of dominance thou ignoramus 
It’s not a perfect fit but better than most 
It’s not a rule per se but I don’t like that defensive penalties are like 5x more punishing than offensive penalties. 
It’s not a traditional OTBHJ but I’ll allow it 
It’s not about the steak 
It’s not about what you like, it’s about the #content
It’s not abroad postage it’s same as domestic 
It’s not clear at all
It’s not even hosted anymore. Google and apples decision plays no factor if no server will host them
It’s not great. Living out of 2 bags and taking up all of her 600 sqft apartment 
It’s not hyperbole to say 2020 will have the biggest humanitarian crisis since Rwanda 
It’s not impossible to change their brand, just gotta get rid of that clunky N on all their stuff
It’s not just hindsight because a lot of people were saying it at the time, not just now that Russ had a shitty season
It’s not just 陈克里斯 is it?
It’s not like it was an ambiguous statement
It’s not like there’s a checkbox for “only available to non locals”
It’s not rocket science but it’s 10x more complicated than 99% of leagues
It’s not rocket surgery
It’s not stolen valor to have a patch lol
It’s not that crazy lol
It’s not, but you certainly don’t win any favors the way you go about it
It’s not. I just met her in fucking Ennis and wondering if y’all knew her
It’s not. I want to get a vibe for the coverage from a non highly attentive perspective
It’s not. There is no record of me being invited
It’s noteworthy tho that he wore it to a SCHOOL party where he was a TEACHER, and they put it in the YEARBOOK
It’s ok Doctors are overpaid 
It’s ok he isn’t in there with me
It’s ok I didn’t threaten to rat out all my friends when they joked that they told lies about me to the feds
It’s ok Jeff they make gluten free cigarettes now 
It’s ok the volume makes up for the low success rate
It’s ok they have a hall of best player of all time
It’s ok tho it’s literally what I signed up for
It’s ok tho kirk bootleg TD for the win coming
It’s ok USSSA allows for a batting roster of 12
It’s ok y’all know I am an OG Elon hater. Like 2016
It’s ok. Me and god know the truth 
It’s okay Anthony Ross
It’s okay becker he ignore all my invites too
It’s okay becker I only reached out to 2 people
It’s okay becker you can soothe the pain with social media posts about the ABCs of melanin
It’s okay I don’t need you to verbalize it. I know it in my heart
It’s okay I still haven’t yet 
It’s okay if it’s field of dreams 
It’s okay it’s axe deductible 
It’s okay Jaime, becker will still give you a blowjob
It’s on my shows I will watch within the next 10 years maybe list
It’s one dance 
It’s only soft power. So considering this is like the biggest mistake of his entire presidency, should they threaten to stop his entire agenda / impeach him if he goes through?
It’s our keeper rules and auction $ trading. They’re not coming back, but it drove them out and it’s a barrier to entry for anybody who wants to join. It’s demonstratively highly unpopular to many. 
It’s over
It’s over the top and very very clever, albeit a bit esoteric
It’s partially his fault, not completely his fault Jesus 
It’s plain
It’s possible BOB is just getting out coached. Colts play calling and balance of plays is just better. Texans look unprepared
It’s possible I jinxed it
It’s possible I’m thinking mainly of trail food lol
It’s possible it’s changed since i flew with them in 2013
It’s possible Jaylen actually thought he was supporting a black fraternity and is just retarded
It’s possible nobody in the world knows
It’s possible the anti-kavanaugh movement was a social media echo chamber 
It’s pretty fucking funny that we say the fix is in on NFL games every single Sunday. But meanwhile in the NBA the fix was literally in.
It’s pretty good. still loses to shake it off tho
It’s pretty incredible that Hunter Renfrow can play professional baseball and football at the same time
It’s pretty much confirmed they broke protocol. There’s photo evidence and everything 
It’s pretty split here between mostly Dodgers and DBacks. Some rangers and Rockies but far less. Absolutely cowboys territory tho
It’s pretty weird. If legit. Which it seems like it is
It’s pretty wild seeing the juxtaposition player/GM power balance with Jerry Krause on the last dance and now Watson who is furious at not being consulted for the GM hire
It’s primed for a collapse 
It’s prob the best analogy to what the Astros were doing
It’s probably AB tho
It’s probably difficult to make it rain...
It’s probably from 200 years ago. I think it will change when I’m out of this training environment alongside all the enlisted
It’s probably like Brandon Tate or Aaron Dobson or some shitty WR who was on the field too much 
It’s probably the worst for Asians 
It’s rarely beaten by any specialized portfolio
It’s really about the number of quality posts
It’s really the relievers who throw 99 but get flabbergasted with a runner on first. Those are the times where pitches take forever. 
It’s refreshing to see Nate take actual nuanced opinions on topics instead of the usual “EVERYTHING AMAZING/TERRIBLE”
It’s rough being a mets fan, but might be rougher to be a Sox fan 
It’s snowing in Nashville 
It’s so classic with the “join the military, get married immediately” thing. I don’t want to be the stereotype, but basically if we ever want to be not long distance, we have to marry
It’s so embarrassing 
It’s so fitting that black democrats in Georgia won the nomination for Biden, and now won the senate to give him the trifecta
It’s so frequent I’m surprised it still faizes you
It’s so fucking annoying
It’s so fucking funny. He’s clearly still so unbelievably butthurt
It’s so funny seeing ALL sideline reporters being like “um actually our jobs are NOT pointless!” in the wake of the Charissa Thompson news
It’s so funny that he’s caught passes from the likes of Kyle Allen, Teddy B, Darnold, and Baker and never once been called a bad teammate. 8 games of Caleb and he’s losing it
It’s so funny that the Simpson was considered terrible Nick then, then we went full irreverent, now we’re back to no comedies 
It’s so funny the Jets have all these young studs and still suck so bad
It’s so hard for anybody to have more than one good album tho
It’s so hilariously absurd, and it only has been getting dumber
It’s so ironic that they went for it and failed miserably, and yet here they are after that turnover on downs 
it’s so irresponsible for you to diagnose him just from TV
It’s so sad he ended up ruining his career. He was on pace to be an all time great. 
It’s so sad that republicans chose and are continuing to choose trump over Romney 
It’s so shitty that the entire negotiation process was about money, and not at all about corona
It’s solid. I don’t crave it though.
It’s something simple. Clearly I forgot tho lmao
It’s still MOSTLY chalk!
It’s still wild to me that the transfer portal and NIL happened at the same time
It’s such a clusterfuck tho
It’s such a shame China’s numbers are garbage because the rest of the world could really learn from them at this point, like we’re learning from Korea, Italy, Taiwan, etc. 
It’s such a well done schtick that it’s almost admirable but also man shut the fuck up
It’s super chill until I start class in (probably) early-mid April, like I do nothing. Then it’s super intense for the first 3 months of class. Then less intense for the second 3 months of class, but still a training environment. Then I get my permanent assignment, and theoretically deploy from there every 6 months or so  
It’s super ironic that Trump doesn’t give two shits about conservative policy at all, but the supreme court is the biggest “policy win” and selling point he’s got amongst constitutional conservatives
It’s Taylor and it’s not close
It’s the allahu akbar of Philly 
It’s the best for the country
It’s the chicken pic
It’s the emyr not the trevor 
It’s the highest grossing movie of all time. And the follow up question is: can you name any character from the movie?
It’s the italian way 
It’s the Kaaba in Mecca, holiest site in Islam. And it’s empty due to coronavirus 
It’s the law and order party
It’s the list of groupme tropes
It’s the most violent swing I’ve ever seen
It’s the NFC championship lmao
It’s the Pats and 3 garbage teams. Jets and Dolphins are perennial laughing stocks. The bills were too until like 2 years ago
It’s the series we need, but not the series we deserve 
It’s the sister album to folklore so it’s probably another non-pop track list
It’s the time of the year for this classic vid. Speaking of, we doing a bracket pool?
It’s the UFC Heavyweight Championship
It’s tight
It’s time for him to go
It’s time for me to be Lieutenant Save-A-Hoe
It’s time for some dank Herb 
It’s time to change the background of that photo to whatever Dartmouth stadium is called
It’s Tom. Big yikes
It’s too bad even we, as fucked as we are, have no Jan
It’s totally true tho
It’s tough because he technically wasn’t “in the hazard” and you can’t force him to take a penalty unplayable, but he was absolutely in the hazard
It’s tough to get FriendZone to take an anti-BC line tho 
It’s tough to separate Shaq and Kobe. But yeah I’d put him in the top 10
It’s tough to think of great players who were managers, as opposed to people who I know because they’re managers 
It’s true that this is appears to be a big repudiation of trump and MAGA. Would’ve been even bigger if Rs nominated more moderates 
It’s true the Burmese got all fed up with the tourists and starting an ethnic cleansing
It’s true though 
It’s true. At least when people piss all over themselves here it evaporates in like 30 seconds, instead of just sitting there and accumulating more piss and drool every day for 50 years
It’s true. But I watch a lot of live sports so I see commercials
It’s true. Not many in this flock can talk the hock
It’s true. Seatbelts are also gay. And sunscreen.
It’s true. You have no balls 
It’s unacceptable that the NFL refs have continuously blown huge calls season after season with zero accountability 
It’s unambiguously bad that trump is using the AG in tandem with his personal lawyer to ask a foreign government to investigate a political opponent with a heavily implied quid pro quo. Idk the exact legality of it all, but it’s certainly not a good look. 
It’s undeniable that Biden is majorly exceeding expectations relative to a week ago
It’s unlikely Mike woodberry has been brought up
It’s unlikely we can use the field next to my apartment for PKs because it is probably in use 
It’s unreal but he’s still prob their 2nd best WR in ability to get open
It’s unreal how the chiefs can put up like 20 points in 2 quarters and nobody bats an eye
It’s very difficult to win without both a great/good HC and QB.
It’s very Soviet lol
It’s weird how the spit in the mouth (never done that btw) seems weirder but it’s not terribly different from an open mouth kiss
It’s weird that it feels like you’re bragging about that
It’s what you say when hit em with the ( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼
It’s what’s on B school Taylor’s clothes after a night with JoeBourqueTu22 
It’s when I have a joke that I think is top tier but nobody else likes, but when I have a shitty joke (of which this one was not) that everybody laughs at. That’s when I get indignant.
It’s why everybody stationed here is itching for a deployment. If you’re gonna be in a butt fuck sand pit, might as well get hazard pay and be close to the tip of the spear 
It’s why Jeff lost 15 pounds 💪🏼 he realized he couldn’t be both so he chose to not be fat
It’s why JJ watt started playing football
It’s why the Mets are my second favorite MLB team
It’s wild how much violence there is in the world that literally doesn’t even make the news. Unless Israel does it of course 
It’s wild how well “take away the opponents best offensive weapon” worked for Pats and now the Chiefs
It’s worth a full read, not easy to sum up in a Tldr. But it illustrates the new “argument-commandment” that has come to dominate the discourse, about how facts are less important than the narrative
It’s your power rankings. You set your own criteria
It’s Zappe time 
Italian American is it’s own dialect
Italian Americans took Italian culture, warped it into jersey shore, and exported it back to Europe 
Italian discrimination can never be too high
It'd be a wild inaugural season
It'd become an 8 man league since Chan is quitting too
It'll throw off his entire morning routine, which is calibrated to the millisecond 
"ITOT - SP500
IEFA - MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East)
AGG - Aggregate Bond
IEMG - Emerging Markets"
It's 2.5 hours from SF though so if you're gonna go that way, it should prob be a one way trip
its 2020! the chinese are STILL doing it!
it's 538's model for WAR, which supplied the article upon which that trivia was based
It's a Christmas tradition that my kids love
It's a complete gimmick lol. If it's great then great, good movie Lebron. If it sucks, who cares it's a gimmick. It will have zero legitimate bearing on his legacy as a basketball player
It's a dude on a platform in a lake gazing out into somewhere
It's a fair point, and I don't necessarily agree with him. I was just pointing out that the father of western philosophy has weighed in on this relevant issue I brought up
It's a good idea Chan
It's a great idea!
It's a great question 
It's a hell of a question for sure.  I guess another way to put it is: do we focus on the 5%, or the 95%?
It's a lot because its often a new course that few of the players know well, and they make it even more punishing for the Open. Contrasts to Augusta where it's identical every year
It's a lot of sugar and bubbles
It's a mandatory interest free loan to the gov
It's a matter of availability I guess. You have to make special requests and they're limited. I tried 😕
It's a plant/seed
It's a pretty cool idea actually. There'd be so many changes. Of course the current NBA owners would never agree to it
It's a shitshow. Johns right turkey joined the battle, but they've revealed their main enemy is in fact the PKK (Kurds), and secondarily ISIS. The PKK is affiliated with the YPG/YPJ/Peshmerga, who are the closest the US has to a surrogate in this war. The US is also officially backing Turkey, which causes major contradictions. Additionally Turkey is loosely in alliance with the SAA (Assad), who the US is officially against and is in some support of the FSA (Syrian Rebels, allied with some branches of al qaeda and other terror groups). Meanwhile all of them are against ISIS, who is actually the weakest of the above parties.
It's a vape but I try do it surreptitiously 
Its actually a lot more to me now than before, but huehuehuehue good one
It's actually an Irish breakfast because that's what I searched in groupme so y'all can go suck it
It's actually the best speech I've heard from him ever, considering how low the bar is. But yeah still mostly fluff.
ITS ALEX SMITH!!!
It's all for legal and compliance reasons
It's all gonna come down to the raiders
It's all legal bullshit and it's not working. We need a new industry where Insurance isn't as much of a factor because costs are so much lower. Make there a clause where you can't sue because you're getting the immediate in-and-out care you need.  
It's almost comical really. "What he's saying offends me! Mommy make him stop!!"
It's almost like this was tailormade to answer your question!
It's alright he's already the best GM Niners have had in 7 years
It's also a run on sentence
Its also fascinating though
It's also impossible to be the 🐐 as a baseball player when there is another active player who is better than you in every facet of the game
It's also proven to be incredibly good for the economies of the tax haven states. Places like BVI and Guernsey are historically very poor places that saw a massive influx of cash from tax dodgers. And they spend a significant amount of cash in those tax havens that would otherwise never go there. 
It's also telling that the ban seems to be made up as he went along. He made this sweeping order, then everybody with a green card is detained at airports causing a huge uproar, and it's like he goes "oh shit forgot about that whole deal, ummm no they can't come in". I have no idea of the legal details around this stuff, it's just so absurd that he has no capability to run anything competently, especially a fucking country
its also vaf expensive to do literally anything, so that could be an issue for your broke ass
It's amazing how acutely aware they are of how they are perceived by different subcultures of the west. Another effect of social media. 
Its amazing how you can take a high school kid and say “this guy will hit 400-500 homers in the majors” and be right. Especially since what like 5 players ever had hit 500 at that time 
It's amazing listening to guys like Barkley, Mark Jackson, and Magic Johnson who truly sound like they know nothing about basketball
It's amazing. But only in CA 😥
It's an unavoidable and pretty significant problem in basketball. In baseball it's pretty meaningless
It's anti-slavery, the colorfully dressed dudes who always want to sword fight, house of black and white and other religions, the Titan/Giant...
It's barely above inflation, but who cares because you have 800 MILLION DOLLARS
It's because I cross state borders every day to catch em all. Nintendo knows my dedication
its been 13 weeks and he's been abysmal game after game, especially his decision making. his ceiling is/was obviously great but man its pretty ridiculous to expect a turnaround at this point this season
It's been 20 minutes just tell us the movie
It's been a roller coaster for sure but it's far from unprecedented 
It's been driving me bananas for the past 30 mins
It's been fucking amazing 
It's been like 2 months since he's held a press conference
It's beyond ironic that under a week ago, he was lambasting the Clintons for discrediting Bill's accusers 
It's borderline criminal we missed that one guys
it's both fun and free! I mean, come on, why wouldn't you try it? I mean, come on!
It's Brett Favre show some #re4pect
It's by the same author of that NYT article about the complications of apprehending terrorist when they have minimal evidence. 
It's called being a fan. Try it sometime, I highly recommend it
It's called The Gers
It's called the United States
It's catchy
It's cause Goody does leg day EVERY day
It's Charlie blackmons walkup, and it rocks
It's close in lots of places
It's close. 
It's crazy that even though the Patriots lost to Broncos D twice, I still consider them the superior team and it's not really even close
It's definitely hockey right?
its definitely not just bros lol. but largely no, we have different own issues, mostly related to the fact that the majority of the force is like 20 year old kids
Its definitely technically possible and I don’t think it would be that expensive either
It's driving me fucking bananas
It's either Jackson Wyoming or Jackson Mississippi. Flipping a coin to decide
It's either June 17 or August 17...
It's even worse for other sports though. Like tennis or MMA or other star driven sports, you could be like top 50 in the world and make next to nothing
It's Florida in 2004 all over again!!
Its fucked
It's fucking hilarious hahahahah
It's fun but not as good as CoD. And the single player is half assed
It's fun to hate on crossfit, but it's actually the closest thing to wrestling workouts that I've seen
It's funded 25% by the Israeli government. Ipso facto
It's fuzzy. The contemporary theory is that powerful party actors (current Republican senators, Fox News, evangelical Christians, free market economists, etc) all have interests that somehow overlap, and therefore want the most electable candidate for their party. Thus they have a loosely organized strategy to accomplish that eventual goal, but also want to tactically advance their own interests. 
It's gonna be close
It's gonna be close as hell
It's gonna be four years of this fucking social-political civil war. Please make it stahhhhp
It's gonna be Hillary vs Cruz, Rubio or Trump at this point. You should read the platforms of those guys
It's gonna be pick and rolls or an ISO every play 
It's gonna be sad when all the Bernie voters realize that Hillary is still the closest to Bernie ideologically and vote for her even though they spent 6 months hating her
It's goody
It's Goody Darrow Joe Me, then Becker is one game out and 5.5 points behind me after this week
It's got a blue and yellow ribbon and he's always wearing it around his neck in his snapchats 
It's gotta be Becker by a longshot right?
It's half the price of shake shack
It's hilarious that the super bowl champs are going to start either a QB with zero career pass attempts or the biggest butt of jokes in modern NFL history
It's impossible to distinguish Shaun King from the facts though. Pretty much every piece of evidence came from the Shaun King article, and he's unabashedly pushing his agenda of defaming white peoples heroes.
It's in Westport CT
It's incredible 
It's interesting though that the Dem party is in total disarray and also has a very negative approval rating too, yet they're positioned well tonight and have good signs for 2018 congressional elections. Trump and the GOP are really good foils I guess
It's just so retarded though. Nothing seems to matter. They're both just so gross
It's Kent Bazemore
It's kind of incredible that Joe Kelly literally could've killed Bregman and everybody is on his side anyway
It's kinda funny how the financial markets just do not take Don seriously at all
It's kinda my MO
It's like backyard football hahaha
It's like half excel half relational database. It mainly uses pseudo SQL 
It's like if LoL was FPS
It's like Miamis D Line can't move laterally, so Pittsburgh has been bouncing outside and running wide out quick screens and it's working like a charm
It's like playing Pokemon snap!
It's like that site emails from an asshole 
It's like we changed the channel from BBC to TMZ
It's like, if it's done really well like saving private Ryan, it will go down in the books as a legendary movie. If not, it will be forgotten. And that's why I don't care
It's Lil Jae from 33rd
It's literally sickening
It's literally the most basic play every time. Handoff or short pass
It's mistakes like this that caused GE Capital to fail
It's more fun to wallow in self pity
It's my own cutoff
It's never over until it's over
It's not 8. It's close to 24
It's not a fair debate because they get triggered
It's not April fools Joe
It's not my fault, I was on drugs
It's not official yet, still has to go through the NY Metro promotion committee, but I passed the BAML client committee. I'll know by October prob 
It's not over yet
It's not that we need MORE white CEOs and Ivy League students, just that we need less non-white ones 
It's not your fault
It's not your right to determine player values for me. Your job is to prove it isn't collusion!!
its notable that the top 3 WRs in the league all made the conf championships. wonder how often that happens
its ok if it’s unfair for the NFL players, but I will not stand for it being unfair to fantasy players
It's ok you all know I do all the real managing anyway ;)
It's ok, nobody looks at it
It's okay 70% of it was a direct quote from Dillon
It's okay Goodwin I redeemed myself with that one
It's okay guys the counter revolution will come eventually. It always does. 
It's okay I don't take it personally
It's okay Jeff my mountain of salt is equally as big
It's okay our boy Marco is gonna pull through!!! ✊🏼🇺🇸🎉
It's okay there's not gonna be any leg kicks, so no commentary on how effective a given leg kick was
It's okay, all I want for my birthday is the Beatdown in Beantown
It's okay, I got explicitly identified as least thankful for
It's on my to do list fuck off
It's one of the biggest problems of today and republicans are idiots for denying it
It's one of the more simple economic concept to understand too lol. And yet #FightFor15 continues to expand in the left platform
its possible Dr Seuss gave me an affinity for rhymes at a very young age
It's possible that some of that is off by a year or two
It's possible that was the argument that swayed the swing voters
its possible the accounts coordinated. But have they ever done something like this before?
its pretty amazing that despite all what goody just said, higher education still emphasizes liberal arts stuff so much
It's pretty cool
It's pretty insane that out of the 4 main factions in the Iraqi and Syrian civil wars, the US has attacked 3 of them within the past week
It's prob about the same as a hole in one for pro golfers
It's prob some old timey starting pitchers
It's probably drugs
It's probably more than $70. Maybe that was the base fee before all the other stuff
It's relevant in that you cannot rule out that Emyr or I wouldn't have picked him up, which you could do if his add date was 10/15 or later
It's ruining my month
It's sad how many people actually do believe those things lol
It's settled then. Brexit is worse than the Panama Papers. 
Its simple. The banks are sick of paying for expensive and unreliable credit researchers to factor into their loan making decisions. Instead they create this system, collect user info, and never loan to anybody who ever had to finance a fucking burrito
It's skins it doesn't matter
It's snowy as balls here
It's so cringey
It's sort of an offshoot of the classic Trolley Problem in philosophy, to which there is absolutely no easy ethical answer
It's sort of kind of released, I guess...
It's sorta the definition of treason 
ITS STARTED 
It's still true
It's such an outdated word too
Its suck you philistine
It's super gay
It's super true
It's supposed to be about what football would be like in 17776. It's the most absurd thing I've ever read and I'm thoroughly engrossed 
It's that dude from the song! Driving the T!
It's the Borga Borg bracket tournament 
It's the latter for sure 
It's the Mexico of American cities
It's the sad truth
It's the same story with her emails. Deny deny deny until caught, then attempt to deflect and disregard 
It's this supercomputer that projects false reality into all of our brains and you need Keanu Reeves to help get us out
It's totally the new gay marriage
It's totally worth it. The younger you are, the more a Roth IRA benefits you (vis a vis a traditional IRA or 401k)
It's tough to find a contingent replacement though. Sorta need to be in or out
It's tradition
It's undeniably the best solution to the healthcare industry ever proposed in this groupme 
It's very fucked up to say this, but if you did Obamacare in America to white people only, it would probably work. 
It's very non-Trumpian
It's well within the rules
It's why I went on that tweet storm a while ago. Is health insurance literally insurance, or is it now supposed to be another welfare stream?
It's why internships have become so damn important 
It's worth 8 minutes of your time
I've actually been told I look like him. I don't see it. Do you guys?
I've actually had that same thing with apples but only sometimes. It's like your tongue swells up and you get this nasty taste/tingle in your mouth
I've actually never seen my hero play sports until these videos. I've seen him at the gym doing things that involve medicine balls, but that was the closest 
I've already jerked off 6 times today
I've always used the go to special button
I've been asking that for 2 months
I've been at 20% for all of January :D
I've been doing some BOFA too but I'm not a huge fan so far
Ive been getting the sense that the country is “successful” for basically the first time in its history, starting 15-20 years ago. And the people are super aware of it and don’t want to lose it. Brexit has been a really interesting topic to talk about, since most city folks seem to be pro EU, but also acknowledge that the UK is the dominant trade partner by kilometres (hehe) and a tax between the UK and Ireland would be catastrophic.
"I've been going a fair amount but just doing exercises and not training for anything. Today I set 3 goals:
Run 3 miles in <20 mins
20 pull ups no rest
100 sit ups no rest
"
I've been on 3 projects. 3 people, 2 people, 5 people that became 3 people. When I interned, team was like 50 people with a bunch of sub-teams. If you're on a good account, they do a good job of doing cross-account networking, but that's not the case on this account (BAML). 
I've been on a Tay Tay binge the past week. She's actually great, new crappy songs notwithstanding 
ive been stuck with every other vaccine known to man
I've been trying to do that for myself for 18 months
I've been trying to pronounce that middle name out loud for a good 45 seconds now
I've called Barry Bonds a 🐐 soooooo many times on here
I've caught like 20 doduos lol
I've changed my mind on the torture subject: torture them all, no matter how high or low value, even if there's nothing to gain 
I've decided to go the Dwight Howard route and get to level 20 before I evolve anything else...
I've enjoyed watching him fail
I've had it, lots of it. But that's just sauce 
I've hated golden Tate for years and angrily watched him be a good player. And the year I draft him in 2 leagues, he reverts to being the balls gobbler I thought he was
I've hated her for about 98% of the time I've known she's existed
I've held this position for years now. Love the music, hate the man. But now he's gone so bonkers that I'm hoping for his music to suck 
I've literally never seen the show I have no idea how it works lol
I've never been more convinced
I've never been more prepared for it
I've never had over the ear headphones, like assuming the ones with a little clip
I've never had stuffing that's actually in the turkey 
I've never heard any of your original mixes but I know you did the thing at Patrons and you seemed serious about when you said you were quitting your job and going on tour with a group
I've never heard of a TSA
I've never heard of archetype consulting 
Ive never heard that 
I've never heard that. That's fucking hilarious
I've never heard the term, but it looks like an investor buys a fuckton of a company in one fell swoop, then uses his large equity portion to immediately make the decisions he wants 
I've never in my life felt so despondent about the people of the United States. Thank god we have the greedy Wall Street fat cats and sleazy establishment politicians to save us from ourselves. And no, I'm not being sarcastic
I've never seen a youtube video more tailored for @Lin Chanuel Miranda 
I've never seen anybody in any setting ever be able to draw unnecessary drama to themselves more than Don. He's a damn retard
Ive never seen him play other than a few highlights on YouTube. But the experts are all saying the guy is a star, and sure he’s possibly/probably overhyped, but again the value goes without saying. If hes half as good as advertised, he’s an amazing bargain. Heck he’s probably technically undervalued if he’s a 1.0 WAR player.
I've nominated 12?? Damn I can't even remember lol
I've only heard of the top 2, and both of them are guys you'd be unhappy to have as your 5th starter
Ive played 2 games of hearthstone already. I'm still at a low enough level this month where I can wreck hoes on my phone
I've played overwatch a few times and I really like it, but I feel like I'd get bored quick
I've ran around the room screaming twice in the last 5 minutes
I've read a decent amount about how blockchain works. It's actually pretty cool and I could totally see it being implemented everywhere 
I've said "I should do my taxes" about three times a day for the past 2 months, so yeah...
I've said what I've needed to say. May the powers that be allow justice to be served.
I've seen much more people do that than I'd expect 
I've seen My Neighbor Totoro and Kikis delivery service too. Both are also damn good.
I've seen Star Wars, American Sniper, Billy Lynns Halftime Walk, Zootopia. That's literally it. 
I've sharted while drunk at least twice 
I've spent a collective $60 on the game. $30 for each adventure. 
I've spent the past 30 minutes voting for Pedroia and Belt while watching my iPhone for Pokemon. Been a pretty productive morning
I've spent the past 4 months trying to make the case for Rubio and all I've done is create a Bernie voter and a Trump voter 😞
I've started 15 minute GoT conversations just to ask if somebody likes Dragons
I've started to do that with my boss with work things. Just say things that are completely incorrect and see if he has any clue.  
I've taken a non-working about 15 times in 3 years
Iverson gotta be up there. Not over Duncan or MJ but close
Iverson? TMac?
Izod stock skyrocketing since Ken "American Hero" Bone rocked the red sweater

Jackie Robinson?
Jackrabbit should-be pick wouldve sealed the game 
Jackson has highest ceiling, and I think he won't get 0. McFadden highest floor, but I don't see him getting a big score. And he might split carries. LaFell is enticing, but he's just been so off with Brady
Jackson is still electric 
Jackson Jackson Jackson!! Admittedly a late add, but that's the whole point of the tourney! The man is a fucking legend and a badass and if Jordy Nelson met him, he would likely drop to his knees and kiss Jackson's likely grossly unhygienic feet
Jackson went 3-36-1 over 2.5 of his 3 seasons lmao 
Jacobs should’ve scored lmao
Jada Stevens
Jaggin Off again

Jai Alai was a new sport invented/popular in the 80s. It was huge in Florida for like 2 years, then completely died out of nowhere. Also had tons of gambling money on it

Jamal Crawford?
Jamarr Chase
Jameis
Jameis enters the game and immediately leads his team to blowing a 17-0 lead
Jameis in the convo, unfortunately
Jameis is such trash lmao
Jameis lack of leadership reflecting on the kicker
Jameis! Laser beam!
James confirmed out. Jeff confirmed out
James Dolan burner account lmao
James Dolan has the rona
James FrankLOLn
James G 🤔 
James Gallo
James Gallo would get it over any of us.
James Harrison
James is provably leaving btw. Assuming that’s the person. Jeff is obviously trolling
James remained friends with them so I’d see them only whenever James was there
James Sturks
James was probably not as good of a player, but he was the GOAT of strategy which is possibly more impressive.  Truly a game changer
James was Tim tebow. High profile name who was cut before week 1. 
Jameson “Bauer” Williams
Jameson Crowder
Jameson’s birthday is probably our best bet, barring a late weekday
Jamie “Marcus Bauer” Bourque
Jamie > Goody > 24B for top 3, IMO
Jamie answer the nut busting question
Jamie are you moving out?
Jamie be more specific
Jamie blew his opportunity to corner the league
Jamie can’t accept or he’s gonna lose like $1000
Jamie didn’t keep wentz...
Jamie do you use a site or bookie?
Jamie I had that same thing on the AT, literally just went away after about 2 weeks. Not sure why or how, but it’s possible 
Jamie I'm FS so that might not fly with intervals but thanks for the lookout
Jamie is def up there as of now
Jamie is Toph
Jamie John Darrow you three are clowns
Jamie over 80 FTs
Jamie that’s like a 5 minute walk lol
Jamie try pick a team that you think will win
Jamie would have been petrified
Jamie you're a hero if this works
Jamie you're not talking about the dropped play action are you?
Jamie, you'd get $40
Jamie’s got a cannon but joes got hockey toughness
Jamie's is spot on

Jeff how is your trip to LA going?
Jeff how much did you draft Corey Davis for this year?
Jeff I found you on SB Nation
Jeff I might honestly do that
Jeff I read your article. It’s all smoke no fire. It mentions the GA chart, then 3 states TX, VT, VA for counting viral tests and antibody tests in their total test count. That’s it 
Jeff I see you traded the shit suit for the 80s Harlem DJ outfit 
Jeff I see you’re happy freely spending your money. Feels good doesn’t it.
Jeff I think that play was specifically for you from Clowney
Jeff I’d have you 4th

Jeff I’m right around the corner from you
Jeff idk how you remember these things
Jeff idk what’s sadder: that you forced us all to in a beta league, or that you deny it
Jeff if you want the actual answer, it's because Bernie isn't posting those hilariously cringeworthy vines or tweeting in Spanish, but he's doing amazing with young voters. Hillary does both of those things and it's amazing. 
Jeff I'm surprised you don't like Bill Simmons considering you both worship the Pats to the point where if you were ever in a room together you'd jerk each other off and smear yourselves in each others cum

Jeff, here's an answer to your question from one of the GOP representatives present:
Jeff, not the center of the movement (that's Utah as of today), but an area in which this type of ideology might have legit appeal. Also, he's not on the ballot because he entered too late, only after it became clear the GOPe wasn't ditching trump. 
Jeff, people like you are pretty much the reason that I think a trump nomination could destroy the Republican Party and start a new party that is both pro-free markets and nationalistic, but also progressive on social issues. 
Jeff, Taylor Swift and Leonardo DiCaprio live here, and I haven't seen them once. How do you expect me to even meet an A list celeb like Anesto, let alone get a drink with him?

JetBlue does board back to front, as I learned this morning
Jets 
Jets +1000 and Bengals +665. What would a 2 leg parlay get you there 
Jets and Titans are frickin awful. But other than them I think any team could legitimately beat any other any given Sunday. Yes even the Browns and saints
Jets are a close second. New coach, new QB, look just as bad in week 13 as they do in week 1.
Jets are going to get a good QB, Rodgers or otherwise
Jets are TRASH lmaoooo
Jets banking the 2024 1st is a late one lol
Jets gonna fire Gase to hire BOB?
Jets got absolutely fleeced. They must have really hated Elijah Moore 
Jets past 3 franchise QBs: Wilson, Darnold, Sanchez. Incredible

Joe, The second sentence of the second point is the key question IMO. Germany is now the only strong economy in the EU, and Brexit adversely affects them hard.

Becker is pretty coordinated but based on his posts in here the past 5 years I can’t imagine he’s in any sort of shape. Nick I know is a great skateboarder but I’ve never seen him do anything ball sports and he just said he went to the gym for the first time in years.

John got it basically. The goal is to get poor people easier access to care. So the economic solution is to give them cheaper and more available care. In order to do that, you have do make doctors that charge less and are easier jobs to get, for example medical students in residency, or other people who can provide the most basic care but are not licensed doctors

John I actually play in a soccer league on Sundays. Game 1 I was a fish out of water but we're on game 5 now and I'm alright 
John I appreciate that you had an awesome wake up jerk this morning
John I disagree with you there. I agree that people's mentality is to implicitly categorize everything, except i disagree that people mesh categories in order to reduce the number of categories. I feel like people naturally categorize people by attributes like gender or racial appearance (for better or for worse), and the push to breakdown those categories is actually un-natural.

Jordy because exactly the reason goody just said. Dude has been a beast since college, and yet we always make excuses for why he's not actually as good as his numbers show. Then it takes him tearing his ACL and missing the season for everybody to step back and go, "uhhh ok maybe he really is that good". Gets no respect for performing, then gets all the respect for being injured. Thats 🐐 status
Jordy because it took him blowing his ACL for anyone to truly appreciate his greatness. He's the Edgar Allen Poe of football

Just arrived in Bennington, VT. Got to the MA/VT border yesterday, so far Vermont is muddy and mosquitoey, clearly a shitty state. I’ve been going about 12-17 Miles a day. I’m fast flat but slow as fuck uphill, like 3.2 mph vs 2.0. It’s pretty fun and I’m starting to get in with the trail vibe, plus I’m going ham on my quads and calves. The shitty parts are that it’s fucking muddy as fucking hell, so you are stepping ankle deep in mud puddles a lot and then you don’t shower for 2 days. Pretty legit tho, I plan on finishing after the Bauer wedding

Just finished 18 (didn’t play great but whatever) and I saw something I’ve never seen before. Like 20 Gordo High students are taking their prom photos literally ON the 18th green. We yell and wave and some parent waves back as if to say “give us 5 mins”. So we wait and they just don’t stop. I’m having a shifty round so I just lay up on like a 130 yard shot. My friend decides to go up there and say something and as he approaches they sorta turn away and scatter. So he goes back to his ball and hits, thankfully a decent shot on the green because they were like 15 yards off the back. Then we putt and they go right back to the green for more photos. Never seen anything like it. 
Just finished 9. 9th hole is a par 5, my third shot is from a bunker about 50 yards from the green. I pick it clean on accident and carry the green and basically hit into the 19th hole patio. I go get my ball and everyone boos. I pick up and drop on the fringe of the putting section, and pitch a 40 yarder to like 15 feet. Everyone cheers as I tip my cap. Quite a roller coaster
Just finished my first listen through. Wow this is a serious album 
Just finished my second flight in the jet. Handled it like a champ this time. They even let me fly it for a few mins. 
Just finished reading it over lunch. Yeah that was really good and really well researched. Joe, I think the reason he played up the grievances of the white working (not middle) class because they're the primary supporters of Trump, and they are the base for which Trump is able to succeed.
Just finished the presidentials. Them white boys are not easy 
Just finished the XFL 30 for 30, not bad I guess. Vince McMahon is a huge prick
Just for The Killers and Eminem 
Just found out my Intel Class is gonna be from 1500-0100, so that’s buns. The major said “yeah so the Intel Mission is 24/7 so your next assignment could be this exact shift, so get used to it. Or you can disobey a direct order and see how that goes for you”
Just fuckin pick a team becker

Just had a team play with no QB and a thrice postponed game played on a Wednesday. Goodell “our protocols are working”
Just had an nice 13.5 hour day. Could really use a whiskey and a cigarette 
Just had BP with the softball team. New guy shows up, dudes pretty damn good. Somebody asks where he played and he says “I was starting shortstop on my reservation team”
"Just had one of the weirdest 9s ever:

Just looked at 500 HR club so I cheated. Big bat wiggler 
Just looked it up. 23 coops opened with Obamacare, on $2.4 billion in taxpayer "loans". All but 1 posted heavy losses within one year of opening. Over half have already closed. 
Just looked it up. At rough and rowdy 2 barstool bloggers fought in the main event. One guy admitted in the post fight interview that he was on roofs. Somehow this spiraled into Rap being pissed and getting into twitter fights with fans, then saying Stoolies are losers. Then he kept online fighting with rest of the barstool staff
Just looked it up. Your ticket is for being a bitch and quitting fantasy sports. Non-challengeable, and actually is usually a felony offense. You got off lucky. 
Just looked this guy up. Apparently was a shitbag marine, got a bad conduct discharge. Not to dismiss his plight but yeah didn’t see that context mentioned on the bird this morning
Just looked. 49/50 in 2008, 50/50 in 2012

Just played my first league golf match of the season. I hit the best putt of my life on hole 6, at least 70-75 feet. I am elated… but 10 minutes later on hole 7, my opponent says lmao ok bitch and holes out from 70 yards for eagle. 
Just played with this guy who was nice and all but one of the most annoying dudes ever. Everything was “oh I was trying to hit a fade/stinger/draw” and “I used to be a scratch golfer” and “try this technique” and “oh this is a new driver so I’m not hitting it well yet”. It was like a montage of the classics. 
Just pointing out, in addition to the aforementioned keepers/budget situation, Emyr "Golden Ticket" Remy also avoids the wasted $3 on the Ivory call option that we made together last year

Just read an interesting convo about legislative term limits. The main negative argument was that it would make Lobbyists more powerful than legislators, and it would also really weaken the legislative branch as a robust, counter-impulse branch
Just read the BCI piece on him. He's from CT, likes that he'll immediately be the lead back
Just read the in depth ESPN article on it. I swear I wouldn't be surprised if 75% of top programs pull some shit like this

Justice Dems are AOC and her people, the most progressive. In the 2018 midterm blue semi-wave, the far left Justice Dems (closest to Bernie politically) failed miserably, where the non-Justice Dem left did very well.

Kanye is a part owner of Tidal. Hella rap artists own like 3%, including J Cole, Alicia Keys, Eminem, etc
Kanye is not going to win
Kanye probably 2 but absolutely a tier drop
Kanye sounds like a kindergartener playing school yard games with his “Dragon Energy” “Ultra Light Beam” nonsense
Kanye wants to sue universal and he just tweeted out his lawyers game plan

Kap replaced Smith under Harbaugh in his first year, team did great for 3 years. Despite the success, Harbaugh didn't respect the Owner Jed York, and that really pissed York off. In the 4th season, Kap sucked and they went 8-8. York saw that as an opportunity to fire (in effect) Harbaugh. Then the whole coaching staff quit, as did half the defense, likely due to the way York handled the Harbaugh situation. Last year they sucked under Yorks new HC Tomsula, they had a shitty offseason/draft, and here we are. 
Kap 🐩

Kasich is definitely most appealing to democrats, but he's the least appealing to the actual conservatives (or at least the Trump/Cruz voters). But republican voters have already proven that they don't care about electability, so that incredibly important asset is simply brushed away. Essentially, I'm already prepared for 4 years of Hillary. 
Kasutori_jack seems like a pretty cool guy
KAT is cool
Kate Upton, Emily Ratakowski, Jennifer Lawrence, and Bill Cosby
Katie 100% has daddy issues
Kattars hands a pretty good so far
Kawhi is prob up there hilariously
Kawhi khabib’d me. Thought he was the man but then turns out he’s a headcase and now I hate him
KC what a comeback
KD being straight mean to Kevin Love
KD can’t hear y’all critics over the applause 
KD can't carry a team either then
KD has always kept it real
KD is currently clapping at haters on twitter and it’s kind of amazing
KD stays at #4
KD tests positive
KD to the Ks would break this groupme lol
KD wasn't conf champion, he blew that one
KD 🐐
KD 🐐
KD, great player, great American 
KDs been better than ever, and Lebron missed the playoffs. Certainly helps his case
KD's personality is pretty opaque from what I understand. Very private, not a showboat, shows absolute and utter disdain for the media... I was wondering if Draymond's personality would clash in that sense
Keep going becker I think you’ve almost dug your way out of this one
Keep going! Rest of the list!
Keep hoping that Marcus is gonna show up but no luck so far
Keep it in 140 characters
Keep me posted
Keep the drama behind the curtain. It helps nobody. 
Keep the SATs
Keep typing. I’m interested in what you have to say here
Keeper at 5$
Keeper list unfiltered 
Keeper rules are clearly terrible. Get rid of all keepers and make new rules. 
Keeper value from auction should be the highest of auction bids, if picked up more than once
Keeping his hips flattened out would be the hardest part. If you can do that, I think we can turn him with a front quarter or power half without too much trouble
Keeps the aesthetic too. I will update it shortly

Kevin a few weeks ago, somebody RTd an old Ayesha Curry tweet about how girls today walk around naked with no self respect. Within a few hours, Kim K posted a nude selfie on Twitter. Got the Twitterverse talking about Ayesha Curry being the anti Kim K
Kevin and Goodwin picked identical brackets, as did Jeff and John. Every single one of us has NE in the super bowl, and all but Joe have them winning it all

Khorasan, the branch in Afghanistan and surrounding regions 
Kicker forgot to come out onto the field, the whole play was set up, no kicker. he rushed out and missed a FG
Kicker is obviously the answer but how electric would it be if a kicker repeatedly kicked to the 1. Like after 2, everybody would be like wow pretty lucky. But then the third and fourth? The electricity would be incredible every 4th and long
Kicker won’t be a specialty position in 5 years 
Kickers are so absurdly good nowadays 
Kickers are so good
Kickers... no real good reason actually. Only that they're part of the game in real football and they suck, and they should be part of fantasy even though they suck. If your team truly is dominant, kickers are more of an afterthought. If your team is closely matched, a kicker could win or lose you the game
Kickoffs are at the 35, so ball is usually recovered around the own 45. I guess you'd want to match that more or less. So yeah starting on the 35 or 30 sounds about right
Kid can get along with anybody, so when he dislikes someone, I love hearing about why hahaha

Kirk cousins did an AMA on r/NFL last night. Instantly a fan. Dude answered more questions with well thought answers than I'd ever seen in an AMA
Kirk Cousins Hail Mary at end of halftime 
Kirk does it again
Kirk Gibson 🐩
Kirk has a legitimate case to be the best QB in the NFC
Kirk looks so hot in that gray suit
Kirk man talk about a 🐐... Started the season as a laughing stock and ends it with a franchise tag. Super positive attitude the whole time, accidentally gave himself a catchphrase, and even did an awesome AMA on Reddit 
Kirk pick six to seal it 
Kirk strip sack, Nope false start. Mattison fumble, nope incomplete. Now that
Kirk’s body is falling apart. He can’t run, he can’t move in the pocket. He can’t even throw in the pocket. 
Kit Kat Big Kat is also at the top. Snickers rounds out the top 3. 
Kite Runner, Hamlet, R&J, As You Like It, Taming of the Shrew, Of Mice and Men, The Pearl, The Giver, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, French Lieutenants Woman, Beowulf, Grendel, Great Gatsby, Fahrenheit 451, Catcher in the Rye…
KITTLE
Kittle is a BEAST
Kizer has been abysmal and the coaching decision to toy with the QB all season has probably hurt more than it seems. Might’ve gotten a win or two if they didn’t fuck around so much
Klay and Iggy done be lockdown on Kyrie
Klay holy cow
Klay is gonna get offered a max, regardless of if he had another $20 mil or so tacked on top
Klay looks like a create a player in 2K
Klay Thompson wore a dodgers hat at the Giants game and it literally lost us the championship
Kliff fired. About time
Klobuchar is low on that list. I’d say 20-1 to win the nom, but if she did, best odds to beat trump

Kramer Jerry Elaine George and elaines boyfriend of the episode bet on a Yankees game, with George as the only one who bets the Yankees. Then before the game, it’s announced the Yankees all have the stomach bug (subplot about it being Kramer’s friends restaurant). So it’s substitutes at every position. They cancel the bet. The Yankees win anyway. George demands his money, especially from elaines boyfriend. They all laugh at him, so he storms out of Jerry’s apartment saying he is shunning all of them until elaines bf pays up. They all have a wonderful time and incredible luck (free Yankees tickets with a clubhouse tour) while George fumes and tries to get in on the tour while trying to keep his shun going.

Lakers is generally pretty high actually, like it spikes but they always had a lot of participation
Lakers lmao my b
"Lakers was real. Dodgers was fake. 

I will not be taking questions at this time. "
Lamar follows this gym on IG
Lamar is ridiculous 
Lamar Jackson got the rona TWICE and is still like “hmm I gotta think about it”
Lamar Jackson should’ve been a WR
Lamar Miller maybe 
Lamb girlfriend showing some deep cleavage for the camera
Lamentably
Lancer legend Markey may be out here winning elections, but let’s not forget where San Jose mayor and recent vandalism victim Sam Liccardo grew his roots 
Landry put everything into that throw to put it 45 yards, meanwhile every QB can throw that from their knees
Landry QB1 ROS?
Langford 😘 
Largely Fell apart when I stopped dating Alexis 
Largely thanks to dumbass Mikael Pokhorov and his sorry Brooklyn Nets 
Larger than life promises, incessant media coverage, the reveling in crudeness, the instant major underperformance, the defense of its greatness, the hope that it fails...
Larry Fitzgerald?
Las Vegas Raiders?
Laser pube removal definitely could be a scene from the Final Destination movies
last 2 big Ners QB contracts were Kaepernick and Jimmy G.  0/2
Last 2 movies I saw in theaters were the Irishman and Parasite. Both must watches IMo
Last 3 Houston possessions all garbage
Last 6 seem decently consistent 
last european league to fall apart so fast since the league of nations
Last hole Chuck hit a great drive but Phil’s was on the fringe so yeah
Last I checked, we were going to split keepers. I.e. Put both of ours in a proverbial pot, then draft them alternately
Last meal? Honestly prob a big ass T bone, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach 
Last nights South Park was hilarious tho hahaha
Last one I watched more than half of was the BC Duke game our senior year and I didn't stay the whole time
Last place either saves himself, or everybody else
Last place punishment: Loser has to write a Facebook post on Gordon Callenders wall telling him youre a big fan
Last point, of Iranian people did try to overthrow the ayatollah, Russia would almost certainly come to the govt’s aid and violently suppress revolts 
Last season 80% of the Ners offense was cool rushing concepts and <5 air yard passes anyway, so my point is that an accuracy dip from Cam is offset by the QB being another backfield carry threat. And again, the hedge is a pretty solid worst case scenario of a cheap backup QB improvement
Last thing I didn’t mention is the unknown economic fallout from this, namely energy exports from Russia to Europe. Germany’s Nordstream II pipeline appears to be dead. The prices of gas and oil could go really high (mostly in Europe). It depends on the degree to which NATO chooses to isolate Russia from the global economy 
Last Thursday was the worst NFL game I’ve ever seen. Can’t wait for it to be topped tonight
Last time a fuckhole spoke at a wedding, he literally tried to make the groom say he would choose his friend over his bride.
Last time I hung out with Erin I got falsely accused of being sexist within 5 minutes. That would get exhausting real quick
Last time this happened he told Daryl Morey to think about how his opinions affect other people, not just financially, but spiritually and emotionally as well
Last time we saw him he was extolling the Cuban govt. No way he wasn’t cheering the taliban 
Last week like 8 butthole congressmen, including rapeyboi Matt Gaetz, came to grill the General about his “mismanagement” of the Afghanistan NEO. I’d never seen him that angry before.
Last year Dameon Pierce and Jamaal Williams were going in the 17th round in July
Last year I got a pair of fuzzy indoor slippers. Solid gift 
Last year I got really high and read like 3 articles on how Fozzy Whittaker was set to be a breakout RB for Carolina, and I spent $20 on him on waivers. Literally nobody else bid for him, and he didn't do shit.
Last year I started a scratched player because i was at a soup kitchen and couldn’t check my phone
Last year I think we tried
Last year I was on #TeamBecker until thanksgiving, figured I'd keep tradition  
Last year Jordy Nelson was out and was traded, wtf is that?? 
Last year was ridiculous and this year is equally as ridiculous. I see the appeal in waiting to take a WR especially after what we saw last year from Jefferson, Aiyuk, Claypool, etc. But man how do you pass up Chase if he’s there at like 15 
Last year you said “you never would’ve approved my trade” when I literally approved your trade
Last: Marcus
Lastly #TeamAli (and also #TeamAlie @Joe Bourque )
Lastly FWIW we are currently experiencing unprecedented duration of growth in the stock market. Many pundits are saying a crash is inevitable, at an unknown future date
Lastly, I'm a big believer in head to head matches. I can't imagine awarding a championship a team that had a single game record advangage over another team, and the two teams played like twice max. 
Late but Nobody ever said it so CharLOLs Clay
Late to the party but having a non-flat payment would be politically unpalatable

Lebron : Obama :: Kobe : Trump?? 🤔
Lebron asking for $50 mil is dumb. He should follow Brady and get a cheap contract to try win one more, and with his son 
Lebron back to chasing his next championship and @Big Baller Bour-Kay owing me $100
Lebron body KD skill
Lebron has proven notoriously difficult to play with
LeBron is 0/2 on the decision
Lebron is the closest thing to a real life superhero
Lebron is unbelievable

Less work for shelbie then
Let her show you what the (dart)mouth do
Let him stay employed, and tell me his shift hours so I can come in and rant about how great trump is and how libtards need to die, and then when he assaults me I can sue roxys
Let him, but he has to make a video of himself singing and dancing to 30 seconds of Blank Space and send it to us all
Let it be Marcus. He throws harder
Let me be the first to denounce Josh Giddey
Let me be the first to wish @Marcus Bauer congratulations on his first fantasy fuckhole championship

Let's just do a normal weekend before that
Let's just play Sunday without becker then
Let's not forget they were huge assholes in hockey in the 1994 Junior Goodwill Games
Let's say 23:30
Let's say Rodgers would go for $50 in the auction. But someone is willing to buy him now for $50. So why should I get the $50 instead of nobody getting that $50
Let's say you're a notch above overtime soccer 
Let's start the fuck over then and agree on new rules
Let's take the HB2 thing for example. He made a big sweeping national statement about it, and sided heavily in favor of the pro-transgender rights crowd. I can see how something like that would piss off angry uneducated rural white people
Let's up the stakes. Loser gets Bortles face tattooed on their chest
Let's you know real early who the good ones are ;)

Like did Kristen pick it out for you to buy and wear? Did you have it for a while and thought it would be a good opportunity to break it out then?
Like do you actually think you’re going to change anybody’s mind? Or is it just virtue signaling to all the other like minded people?
Like does UCLA keep its perennial 10-25 ranking or could they actually become a contender? 
Like driving right, jumping fadeaway and chucking up a runner style hook shot, hoping it goes in

Like everybody had MySpace but used AIM to chat
Like fast food chain restaurants
Like for somebody who plays all the time as he supposedly does, he’s gonna have some solid shots. But it’s always the lowlights posted so that’s all people have seen
Like havarti is good with both. Brie is great/good with crackers and kinda shitty on sandwiches

Like he had 8 holes triple or worse
Like he knows how he wants it to end but he doesn’t know how to get there. And he doesn’t want to force it

Like he’s a piece of shit but looks 100% innocent and literally got his career ruined by a lying hoe and cancel culture 
Like here look at this:

Like I said a few weeks ago, there doesn’t seem to be any correlation between state policies and Covid spread that I’m aware of
Like I said before, the literal privilege hierarchies by race, categorizing people like Greeks/Turks/Jews/Palestinians into racial categories based on their perceived success, categorizing Asians as white adjacent because we succeed, teach things like whiteness is like an original sin, calling things like “rugged individualism” a form of white supremacy
Like I said I also tried for OBJ
Like I said I tried this with OBJ as well
Like I said I'm a big proponent of environmental policy, it just has to be acknowledged that it will add another economically-bad layer to many blue collar businesses and hurt workers. 
Like I said it’s impressive. The last time we played I was fully prepared to be an Olympic level hater, but when you double 3 holes in a row, I realized I just don’t have the capability to continue full throttle on the hating. It’s a skill that you have that I just do not.
Like I said, cheaper than my basketball, soccer, and softball leagues 
Like I said, I hold John Thompson’s fantasy opinions in higher esteem than Matthew Berry’s 
Like I said, I'm pro Daz and I think 7 wins next year is a >50% probability. But I'm not blindly optimistic about it. Also I never cared about BC before 2010 and therefore don't expect 9 wins a year.
Like I said, it’s a question of liberalism, even (especially) when it’s not in your favor 
Like I said, retarded

Like if a spread is -3.5, it is better to just treat it like a pickem
Like if fake disabilities and using pronouns. Or having live laugh love decorations and thinking the election was stolen. 
Like if it’s a zone blocking scheme, it’s basically up to the RB to read the techniques and choose to cut in B, C, or wider
Like if nobody had yet
Like if the Bills moved, would they root for the giants?
Like if they did and he woke up, he’d be like “what did you not see the fucking tattoo?”
Like if they didn’t blow 28-3, is Matt Ryan really a HoF player? No way 
Like if you give your order straight with no mistakes, she's probably okay. But if you say "oh actually I'd like large fries not medium", there's gonna be trouble
Like if you made 10% over 2008-2010 you're a beast
Like if you mean all the protests, I'm not surprised. If you mean literally trying to petition the electors to not do their job and undermine democracy, yes.

Like Josh Allen, you gotta take the bad with the good
Like kellyanne was terrible but the other two are wayyyyyy worse, and then it’s just who’s hotter
Like Kenny St John was a nice dude. Just every conversation I ever had with him was just off the rails weird (and entertaining)
Like let's say some builder builds a house, and it looks great but falls apart in 2 years. Homeowner sues, builder says "hey it never said in the contract that it would stand for 2 years". That's bullshit
Like level one

Like one where he’s planning his retirement and is clearly super out of things to do
Like other players my mom could name, 100% Giannis and KD, maybe Jokic? Zero young guys 
Like people would try to get it to write eulogies about Biden, Trump, Hitler, Stalin, etc and see what it would agree to and not agree to
Like professor thoms was a Patriots bar, but 40% of the crowd on a Gameday was fake fans
Like putts you expect 70% and I hit like 90%
Like remember that mini concert that was supposed to support the musicians of BC? Shut down by administration because of bullshit, and they clearly did not help them fix what was wrong to enable it
Like reviewing a NFL game drive log on ESPN 
Like seriously 20% of American report losing an average of 26 lbs. yeah fuckin right

Like skydive without a parachute
Like take any of the Weirdos from BC and it’s them over Bill every time

Like that might cause permanent brain damage
Like that the dodgers are bad
Like that’s 1/10 in serious weapons (fuller if we’re being generous), and 3/10 in serviceable players

Like those are very serious, genuine responses to an absurd question from a clearly bonkers person
Like Tiger or US olympians or UFC guys don’t count
Like tigers still the biggest star in golf by a long shot, and he's sucked for years
Like today, a person who says "I want to kill people and tear America apart" has the exact same voice as some one who spends their day volunteering in the inner city and rescuing puppies
Like UNLV can’t pay him, so some third parties offer to? And those third parties renege on the deal, so he sits out and punishes UNLV?
Like way more than I remember 
Like what is it in the industry that makes it lose money?
Like what the actual fuck
Like what the FUCK is that call
Like what weekend?
Like what?
Like when Dede Westbrook said he’d go for 200 yards in his first game. Bernie (and others) are out here doing the same thing, except people actually believe them. 
Like when I said the collection of FH tropes should be called the Troposphere and nobody laughed
Like when I saw “multiple mid round picks” I half expected WAS to be getting picks
Like when Michael hit Meredith with his car, thank god it wasn’t like Pam or Jim
Like when that whole thing about Trump ignoring Russian bounties on US troops in Afghanistan news story came out, it was pretty cool to be able to read the actual report everyone was talking about
Like who the fuck knows the words to timber

Like wtf wizard people?! Fucking muggles are way smarter than that
Like you can come straight out of med school, don't need residency. Or something like that.
Like you could’ve taken the “prioritize American lives take” and that would’ve been so much more marketable. And simultaneously, the “opening businesses while corona is still a threat wont magically fix the economy” is also a marketable position, and probably true
Like you gonna take your biggest strength on D and neuter it?
Like you have a totally legit point but then you ruin it by invoking slavery 
Like you literally paid for your food and just fucking left
Like you’d think they’d never be able to live up to the classics of our childhood but Moana, Frozen, Wreck It Ralph, etc have been real good
Like you'd be lucky to be 6-6...
Like, all of them in the past 20 years...
Like, are the consequences a factor at all?
Like, I have about an annual $1000 trade deficit with Chipotle, but it's certainly not a one sided deal
Like, I'm all for computer umpires and shit, but the this would fundamentally change the entire game
Like, league-ruining bullshit
Like, no way they survive this right?
Like, the insurance company wouldn't even break even.
Like, was Mike krzyzewski a good coach?
Likelihood of being gay went from 0.001% to 0.0000001%

Lmfao it wasn't as bad as the story makes it sound. Basically the way they work is that all entry level employees are given roles as an admin (aka secretary) to somebody important. Rob was an admin for a bigwig in the market research department. In order to get promoted to a real position, you have to apply up. Boss loved him, gave him recommendations everywhere, and he was confident. He applied to be a market research analyst, took a very thorough evaluation, and had his interviews. Apparently he bombed his evaluation, and they bluntly told him that he's not qualified to be a research analyst, as per the Daleo principles. Major ego crusher there. He bitterly applied for a role in client services, only to be rejected from that department as well for some reason. After the back to back rejections, he quit.
Lmfao it's not chandler?!?!

Lol and apparently Cumberland disbanded its football team before the season, but there was a $3000 fine if they didn't play the game, so the Baseball team's student manager got 15-20 of his frat brothers to form a football team hahahaha
Lol and everybody hated Allen on that team. But yeah bulls, this is pretty friggin bad in less than half a season, and I don't see how dudes like Wade are gonna get over it. And now it's like the young guys are gonna half to choose sides or something

Lol how do you know the intricacies of girls lax rules but not NBA rules?
lol i bitch to you all more than I should. It's an interesting situation and at least there's a fair amount of comedy in it
Lol I can see that. I think that's just his personality though: super outgoing and friendly to the point where it seems fake. Never was good friends with him though. 
lol I don't care but I'm sure you're aware that she's reached demigod status amongst many women
Lol I don't hate lifting but I see very little physical change. I can burn fat easily but putting on muscle is very difficult. I'm often tempted to just stop lifting and focus on cardio and high rep lifting

Lol in London today there is a pride parade and a small group of lesbians is protesting the parade because trans people are erasing lesbian identity, or something
Lol interesting question, more about team depth than anything else. Kyrie / Love? Ibaka? DeAndre Jordan?
lol is that where the Acn office is?
Lol it certainly would be. But I'm guessing it's going to be a lot like Bush-Cheney being investigated for war crimes. Special investigation is kicked off, quietly fades into obscurity forever 
Lol it might be a stretch. But he’ll be $31 next year. Depending on how the backfield looks next year, it’s far from implausible 
Lol it’s a pretty simple concept. I figure doctors both of jurisprudence and medicine can comprehend it

lol that actually sounds right up my alley
Lol that Audi commercial was pretty good tho
Lol that sub is pretty funny but wow a lot of “Instagram socialist” posts too
Lol that would be collusion!!
Lol that would/will be a shitshow that dies out and ends up in nothing
Lol that’s like the most complicated question ever. But exit strategy depends on goals. If the goal is to run the Taliban into the hills then hand the keys back to the National govt, that’s pretty easy, despite long term inefficacy. If the goal is to state build, well... don’t really need to go there. Neither is a “good” option, but we’ve seen what happens when the UN/US invades and topples a murderous dictator (Saddam), and we’ve seen what happens when we do nothing (Assad). 
Lol that’s the most likely of them so far. Already had an interview
lol thats it i thought i'd missed something
Lol that's it? I remember it being a bigger deal 
Lol that's ridiculous. Top 3 teams and top 8 teams were better
Lol that's so sad though. It's like gambling on Kap gets you 10-6 at absolute best, or can get you 5-11. And Blaine is probably safe to assume 6 or 7 wins... What an exciting time to be a niners fan
lol that's that the people say. I'm going to the gym and trying to sweat out the rest of this shit
Lol that's what I thought was so funny. Their background research was so extensive, and yet they still completely missed the entire point of their own argument
Lol the dude hating on BCI is being a misogynist prick but I don't even care because I want BCI to lose hahaha

Lol welcome to politics
Lol well at least he didn’t capitulate
Lol well good call but holy shit that was anti climatic for a dramatic ending
Lol well I frequently get the opposite, and it's fucking frustrating.
Lol well in my book, that gives evidence that his friendliness schtick is all a front
Lol well on the "bright" side, there was a unified outcry and shaming against him as a joke stealer when he got his TV show, which ended up getting canceled before it started because of the outcry. From what I understand, he has plateaued since nobody in comedy wants to hire him now
Lol well put. Im just surprised that since it’s proven that they never cared about Covid outside of postponements, why the charade of pretending to care so much all season. Was it just to get players to get vaccinated and lower the odds of them getting Covid while also pretending they care?
Lol well shit
lol well we can toss that application in the trash
Lol well you're still right, considering Jeffs screenshot

Long story short I have to go back to the MEPS one more time. That should happen sometime next week
Long term, I'm not sure. The distrust of the DNC as an establishment body probably will last, but it might not matter. Perhaps the biggest story is that it reveals Russia 1) has hacked the DNC which could mean they got the Hillary server, and 2) is clearly on Team Trump. 
Longer afternoons mean kids have an extra hour of practice 
Longer term id replace the young guys with Matt Ryan and Mariota

Look at Syria. Obama balking on the red line was putins go ahead to step in, and he clearly has no problem with crimes against humanity as long as it furthers Russian international power. 
Look at the circle jerk (um actually it’s called annulus co-stimulation 🤓) from the stethoscope boiz
Look at the seeding in the bracket. Chan has the 3 seed matching up with the 5 seed, and 4 vs 6. Should be 3v6 and 4v5.

Look just because I want to colonize the Middle East doesn't mean you have to make those crazy accusations
Look on the bright side goody, you both can read the same amount of fan mail

Looked like they were lining up to do that
Looked up the Preseason rankings. Interesting that Washington was above Texas
Looked up Tyrann Matthieu. Dude was drafted 69th overall. I know risks with his year off an all, but holy cow is that a steal
Looking at 13005 cents if Biden is POTUS 💵 💵 💵 
Looking at the Celtics last few drafts, he hasn't been terrible. Smart and Rozier are solid, and there were a few years where everybody missed. 
Looking correct in AZ as well. NV no data yet. GA might be headed to a runoff for control of the senate (deja vu, wonder if Don tells everyone not to bother voting again)
Looking for advice here. My retarded brother got scammed by some dude on IG. I've been able to find his Facebook, school, city, etc. Is there any way to coerce him into refunding the money?
Looking for any way to defend Lacy here, but struggling to find any legit reason
Looking for QB/RBs, not desperate to make a trade, but for those who need WR help, I can certainly provide that
Looking forward to the mini FH open
Looking forward to tonight's write up. I absolutely hate the idea that we should strive for keeper value for bust players
Looking like 222-213 R, a 9 seat majority
Looks good in orange ✅
Looks like a case for the hardy boys
Looks like a good sell on Langford 
Looks like a man who’s disappointed that Don is about to announce his 2024 candidacy 
Looks like a very fair trade
Looks like an EOD unit
Looks like another stormy night at the capitol
Looks like Dr. Lt. Kelleher was right again
Looks like Florida gonna Florida 
Looks like Fowler to the Cards
Looks like Friday 8/28 at 9PM is works for me, Marcus, Becker, Jamie, and Kevin. Need confirmation from @Big Baller Bour-Kay  @Ryan Darrow and @Skimmer 
Looks like marcus and I are correct and the rest of you are lib cucks, except Jeff who’s basically Josef Stalin 
Looks like the pats gonna have the Toons (#tbt to the 2015 TotF)
Looks like the putting course at Pinehurst
Looks like the triage is that urban black people exceeded turned out, rural white people didnt. Not a lot of actual flippers but a lot of rural white people just didn’t come out for Moore
Looks like the War on Christmas is over folks. The libs won. 
Looks like this weekend we’re gonna see some ground force invasions for the 2nd time in 2 years
Looks like Trump is gonna dominate in Florida 😕 Ohio will be close
Looks like warnock with the early lead
Looks like Washington got rid of two Skins this season 🤔 
Looks like we got Iranian TBMs launched from Iran at the US Consulate in Erbil, Iraq
Looks like we’re down to 6 next year boys 
Looks likely the Russian Black Sea Fleet Flagship was sunk by a Ukrainian anti ship cruise missile. Another gigantic if true event
Looks true, might actually be a big deal 
Loooooot of questionable flags that drive
Looooot of it was fluffy IMO
Loose end. Needed to tie it out
Loot that shit like its ferguson 
Lopez has only one year left
Lord have mercy on the doctors!!

Lose to the Browns for their first win in 2 years. Now getting blown out by the Bills backup backup backup backup QB
Loser has to do butt stuff
LOSER HAS TO RELEASE THEIR TAX RETURNS
Loser has to write anything they want on Gordon calendars wall once a month
Loser mentality

losing 3 times in a row to trevor did not sit well
Losing sendejo and Rhodes man that’s tough for the Vikings
Loss to the lions*
Lost because of a roughing the passer call that was literally as clean as can be.
Lost me my matchup against Jaime
Lost to the Seahawks and ravens in identical fashions 
lot of baby shark on there?
Lot of classics like Montana, young, Lott, and Clark. Then a fair amount of recents like bowman, Willis, Gore, and Kap. Then a few Hyde, Jimmy G, Joe StaleyF and Eric Reid jerseys 
Lot of college republican club members being identified at the Charlottesville rally. Or at least more than I'd hope
Lot of pressure on this new album to be good
Lot of soon to be outdated conferences in there 
LOTR, Departed, Parasite are top 3
Lots of apps were having issues this morning. Spotify was down, ruined my morning commute. Idk if it’s back yet
Lots of comments like “anybody who voted warren is basically supporting trump”
Lots of effort went into these!
Lots of mucus in the lungs but not like hard to breathe. No fever
Lots of people are saying it
Lots of people in NoHo / Chelsea 
Lots of questions to be answered. But yeah there is no world in which PGA leadership doesn’t look terrible, and no world in which the LIV defectors don’t look like they got off scot free
Lots of sacks when the QB steps up are green dogs
Louie was a bad dude?

Loved Clash of Clans back in 2014-16
Loved it. Yes you'd be able to see a lot, but you'd probably want another day or so. It's a really bike friendly city so that's good to keep in mind
Loved seeing guys like Jameson Williams be bid up back and forth by Marcus and Kevin bots 
Low expectations, but turns out you have a big swinging dick this year
Low hanging fruit puns aside. Why do you have a Indiana Jones hat?
Low key Gilmore 
Low key insane to tag from first there
Low key interested in what your first dance song was. Becker too. 
Low key top kyrie moment: when playing in Milwaukee, the Bucks we’re going to have a retro court paint job. Kyrie said he might not play because he thought they were using the original wood from the 80s that would be unsafe.
Low key Tristan wirfs
Low mid. Agree. 
"Low on sleep. 

Not a ton to say other than that it was a frickin stomping and probably the only blowout SB that I’ve enjoyed end to end. Happy for saquon. 

I was legit worried about the fix after that 1st drive ABJ OPI.

Eagles DL dominated with no blitzes. Worthy looks like a monster after a rough first half of the season. Hollywood a non factor surprisingly, playing behind frickin Juju. 

We didn’t get the real commercials unfortunately, just Armed Forces Network “don’t drink and drive” PSAs. 

Suck it chiefs you guys were totally outclassed."
Low over, bad defenses. Both true, but clearly I overestimated the offenses
Lower odds than democrats taking the senate
Lowest ever to make playoffs
Lowest rate is Trump, then Bernie, then Hillary
Lowkey think the pats have a shot here

Luke because of the obvious. Boris has top 5 most hilarious bodies in professional sports but other than that he's completely forgettable
Luke McCown does not look like a good QB

Made a fun stop on the drive today
Made a typo making fun of your typo. DAMMIT
Made it
Made it ~6 minutes into the season before the first “patriots got screwed” comment
Made it 90 seconds
Made it though 3.5 Blueprints for Armageddon and all I wanna do is talk about WWI for the next month
Made it through 2 minutes, too cringey once again
Made it to Baghdad finally
Made like $160 last night tho so that wasn’t terrible 
Made the arena questline pretty damn tough actually
Made the bold decision to skip Killarney/Dingle in favor of Ennis/Cork

Mail it in married FHs. If Tom fucking Brady can’t stay married, the rest of us don’t have a shot
Maine is right
Mainly @#Just📠✅ and @🐟🦴🩻 
Major changes are bottom 3 teams all get a 14% chance at top pick and 40% at top 3 (instead of worst team getting 25% at top pick and 64% at top 3) worst team can get at worst 5th pick instead of 4th. 
Major cockblock last night tho. Met these 2 Canadian girls, one cute one not. Not cute girl was the best wingman ever getting me to hook up with cute girl, but then proceeds to major cock block at the end of the night
Major exceeding expectations by the Pats so far
Major HIPAA yikes 
Major news in Alamogordo NM (where I live): the town has opened its first bar. Huge development for this soon-to-be booming metropolis.

Make sure angela isn’t nearby when god smites you for telling such terrible lies
Make sure to get lots of flour
Makes Iguodala that much more important since he can sorta guard inside in addition to perimeter
Makes it very difficult for the low paying guys to not be scabs, if they have that power at all
Makes me think anyone can. 
Makes me wonder what the Supreme Court appointments would look like with President Hildog plus a GOP Congress 
Makes ridiculous American sports contracts look small
Makes sense
Makes sense. At the beginning of the season I certainly under/over estimated all of those teams, respectively 
Makes sense. Like how everyone in NC loves the heels and hates duke 
Makes the bears trading a 4th for $15MM Nick Foles that much funnier
Makes the CFP look like the lottery
Makes you wonder if Tavon Austin would be a beast anywhere else
Makeup calls or whatever, 1) that should've been a T on Lebron, 2) that was a foul on Jefferson. Both indisputable 
Making me think the app is buggy
Making phrases stick is my favorite thing
Making them not for profit means more government regulation, and I'm against that 99% of the time

Man imagine becker having to tell all his patients parents that he sent an email to his friends work email with a porn link and that he “literally couldn’t stop cunning” 
Man imagine being a bulls fan in the 90s. SIX championships in 8 years 
Man imagine how easy it would be so to put Michigan, Washington, FSU, and Texas if only Auburn hadn’t blown a 4th and 31
Man Jeff too bad you sucked a fat dick last week or you’d be the 2018 champion
Man lemme learn you about the Ners
Man listen to that crowd!!
Man look at this team
Man lowest I got was Bill Mueller 1%
Man not gonna believe what was posted in the FH about Zappe
Man on the Moon 2 is better than I remember.  Scott Mescudi vs the World, Revofev, Marijuana, Mojo So Dope, Erase Me, Mr Rager, Ghost are all Cudi classics
Man on the moon 2 was great too. And so was the mixtape. Then it was the tubes minus like 2 songs here and there
Man on the Moon might be the album of our mini-generation (born in 1990-1993)

More of the same for the most part. Houthis still control Sana, still fire missiles indiscriminately into Saudi whenever they can. They also tried (and failed) to shoot a missile at a US Navy ship yesterday. Saudi air strike in Sana killed a bunch of funeral-goers, who may or may not have been terrorists

MRE is Meal Ready to Eat. It’s a non-refrigerated meal in a bag. It usually involves a main course, a side snack or two, a dessert, and a drink powder. They’re almost always terrible, but yeah some are less terrible than others. The chili Mac is the “best”. Having one for a meal really is fine, but having nothing but MREs for 3 days gets irritating, and more than just in the bowels way

My all injury/suspension team would win the league hands down
My analogy isn’t quite correct. Thernos did have evidence that it worked. It was just faked.

My biggest takeaways are: most agree that NAFTA helps the American consumer, its disputed how much it hurt American manufacturing (e.g. Auto) but most agree it was bad, everybody agrees American manufacturing would have tanked anyway regardless of NAFTA

My dad is a Diglett, but all 3 of his kids are OTF
My dad liked the Jay, Ay, Kay pattern
My dad loves the Peyton nationwide commercials
My dad tried out for Tulane football when Mack Brown was the coach.  He told him "Son, we have a great intramural program"
My dad was at that game
My dad was saying that the gigantic volume of robinhood traders and the news that informs their decision making has become an actual needle mover in the markets

My fav Giants writer said we shouldn't even be considering trading for him because that would be conceding moral high ground to the Dodgers, which is simply unacceptable on all levels
My fav prof from BC had the same thoughts. He said he had a college age daughter and said all she ever did was write the same paragraph in different ways over and over to reach the page limit. 
My fave BC professor was my econometrics prof who had no minimum page limit and urged us to keep our papers as short as possible. He said he has kids who just graduated college, and all they did was write reworded sentences over and over.
My fave restaurant in NYC is German 
My favorite article about the HR derby by the best baseball writer on the planet
my favorite children’s book Holes has been ruined for me
My favorite is TD + PAT, commercial, kickoff, commercial 
My favorite is the catch, brace the fall, frame the ball next to the camera 
My favorite moment was probably Pat being mad that the pop a shot score was too high (it did reek of foul play) so he unplugged it and reset it so he could get the high score, as was tradition
"My favorite naming story was this guy who turned the key on his lit stove too high, and actually pulled it out of the socket. So with the key out, the stove starts spouting flames out the side of it, guy freaks out and knocks it over so this flamethrower stove is rolling all around the campground, and rolls under the shelter until it dies. 

He got named Charizard."
My favorite part is how he drags him to the right to bait him before he changes direction and slams that mothafucka on his head

My favorite part is how you had the joke saved up for days
My favorite part of golf is the weed

They proceeded to give every character either +10000 or -10000"

My grandparents gave me a sinicized name 卓敦 / zhuo dun / “jwoh dwun”. But when I was in HS I went by 可乐喝 / ke le he / “kuh luh huh” because it sounds like Kelleher and literally means “drink soda” which I thought was hilarious 
My groupme is really buggy rn. Anybody else?
My guess is a lot probably had to do with the Gold Rush, which was upriver in Sacramento. People would come in the golden gate, then dock in the east bay before going to Sacramento, instead of docking in SF
My guess is at the beginning. I think the combination will never be cooler than room temperature, so in order to get it the coolest the fastest, you just combine them immediately
My guess is Eddie "Mission Control" Bravo -> Joe Rogan -> MMA fans
My guess is that registering is a bigger hump than voting itself
My guess is they were preloaded with an explosive or something and somehow mossad got Hezbollah to use them
My gut says they'll patch that feature. No reason to make the game harder for its most dedicated players
My gut tells me it’s gonna be Clarendon or Ballston. I feel like the bang for buck is so much higher out there. 
My gut tells me when the dust settles, things won't be that different financially. I also think a free trade deal between EU and UK is likely
My hands are clean. Cleaner than Kevin’s right before he puts in an A line.

My hero
My hero is back in the news. And this time, a failed sexual assault smear attempt against Dr Fauci
My high school wrestling coach was one of them short stocky and extremely strong dudes, and was obese by BMI. He loved jumping in our workouts and beating us at sprints and yelling "you guys are letting an obese guy beat you!!"
My hole 3 was one of the worst in recent memory. Par 3 120 strong tailwind, water in play. I choose to hit a 56 110%. Chunk it next to water where I have to hit lefty. Shank it into the water. Then pitch on and 2 putt for triple. 
My homes
My hope is that the players get blackballed by all the other teams, and lose tens/hundreds of millions of dollars in opportunity cost of their potential contracts
My house growing up had a basketball hoop in the driveway, then half grass half stone patio in the back

My league does h2h points so very different format 
My legs got weak fastest. I only lifted once in Ireland so that was no good. But I went from being able to do 1x5 at 225. Then just yesterday I struggled to do 5x5 at 185

My Obamacare plan costs me $240 a month and gives me a $7000 deductible. If that’s a hint of universal healthcare, it’s no bueno
My office had a Diwali lunch on Tuesday. Some of the best Indian food I've ever had 
My office is all Indian as you may or may not know. I've observed that traditional Indian people show very little emotion, enjoy the small talk and don't think it's meaningless like we tend to do, and also don't seem to mind awkward pauses. 
My official registration notice came in the mail yesterday 
My opinion is I didn’t get to watch the fucking national championship and the instructors were all talking about it the next day and joking “oh y’all see the game? Jk lol sucks for you”
My opinion is that you leave this to the communities. Don't engage it at the state or federal level.
"My opinions on those:
1) Support it, but Mexico isn't gonna pay for it
2) Worst idea ever
3) Good idea, but won't solve anything significant. Also directly contradicts 2
4) Unconstitutional "
My other favorite in here was when Marcus was crusading against voting and how one vote doesn’t matter, to which I replied: “Marcus your “one more cookie doesn’t matter” mentality is why you’re wearing size 38 pants”

My plane wifi is shit haha. I'm 30 seconds behind
My point was that it's not like the falcons didn't have a chance to seal it. "Deserved" was the wrong word
My point was there aren't a lot of AFC teams that I have faith in. Literally just the Pats, and they've got the injury bug. Raiders I'm conditioned to expect a collapse 
My polywhirl is 25 candies away from being my strongest by far. It's almost full up on the CP meter

My question was: if 95% of people pay for 5% of people, who does the "obvious ethical solution" side with?
My rams dislike may be affecting my priors

My take is you gotta target the colleges. They’re the ones profiting off the loans with no downside. 
My takeaway is that Barry is somewhere 2x and 3x as good as Jeter for most of their careers 
My takeaway was that he cares more what I can do for him specifically than what I'm doing for the client
My team got cut from 5 to 2 last week so now I'm working for like 80% of the day 😕
My team got last place and you're declining??

My tentative plan is to take all my Accenture stock, a bunch of money I have in the SP500, sell it before Dec 31. Then wait until Jan 1, put it all in my Roth and allocate it how I want. That’s the best thing to do, if I understand correctly 
My top concern is that when shit hits the fan, I want the people in charge to be smart and trustworthy. I care more about that than repealing the SALT tax.

My unprofessional view is that the slippery field should benefit wide receivers on cuts, because it would be even harder for a DB to react

Myles Jack getting worked 
Nabers just killed a man
NAFTA is amazing, I hate that both of these idiots are against free trade
Nah
Nah
Nah
Nah a true Bernie bro would marry someone who’s committed bank fraud
Nah actually fuck that. 100% gunning it. I’m not gonna 50 cent it and be a meme. If I sail it or something nobody remembers. If I throw a dart then that’s epic.
Nah actually pretty confident I wouldn't be pissed, award shows are just retarded circlejerks anyway
Nah Amsterdam would be closer to $100-$150, since just one costs $50
Nah antivaxxers should be old or sickly so they die when they get Covid. Herd immunity faster that way
Nah Baker is terrible. Worse than Teddy, Sam Darnold, Kyle Allen, and late career Cam Newton
Nah Bovada doesn't work in NY. BetOnline 
Nah bro in this scenario, you are the poor
Nah bruh its a jump shooters game now
Nah but the profiles were a big deal. And the little avatar icons
Nah but they didn’t get a keeper moved past the deadline
Nah clevelands gonna blow it
Nah couldn't be
Nah don’t respond. I’m with marcus here
Nah drafting a QB is still the way to go IMO if you wanna win a championship 
Nah fam that’s cuz the tall euros don’t have athleticism like KD and Megatron
Nah fuck you it’s still fun as hell every time
Nah green had a miss, whatever. Morris’ pass was awful, but still crunch time split second I get it
Nah he actually said “can I get another hit”
Nah he was guilty
Nah he’s helping me move
Nah he’s just a weirdo. I literally had no idea who he was until I was his roommate 
Nah her and her glorious tits were friends with the guys next door
Nah he's too young
Nah his wife got hot
Nah homes it’s all about eliteness at QB and value at RB/WR/TE
Nah I disagree there. That could open the floodgates for corruption. If you don't want to keep someone, you should have to put them up for auction instead of reaping the rewards of some under the table trade
Nah I don’t make them pay, which makes me a slut not a tute 
Nah I think he spun out a quarter mile away 
Nah I’d kill him. Not close
Nah I’m at a Wendy’s 
Nah I’m on team forgiveness here. He’s not had a single issue since the DV (to my knowledge), and he’s marrying the victim so she at least believes he’s changed. If you believe someone can change and be forgiven, he’s the poster boy for that
Nah it’s definitely Don. Tubs is too much of a football guy to make up something so egregious 
Nah it’s okay
Nah it’s safe. There hasn’t been a murder at that field since the two in Oct 2021
Nah Joff you'd be like Tom Brady, still hungry for more and working to improve every day as if you were a rookie
Nah Landry is #good
Nah let’s just end it now
Nah man I saw urban doing worse. Trump had more votes cause of turnout, but not by percentage
Nah man that’s far from guaranteed at this point
Nah moss is better than rice. And I say that as a Ners fan
Nah Mr Bauer’s first impression of me is me walking up to Top Golf with my AT backpack
Nah no hate at all really
Nah not really I take that back. Like peevish 
Nah see I disagree there. I think you want to choose the team you have the most confidence in every time (especially after one loss / week 8)
Nah see I think 4 = orgy no matter what, everything else is a subcategory
Nah see that's the whole point. They do in every sport except soccer, which is the whole basis for the argument. But again, you negotiate and sign the contracts, and if you happen to exceed expectations in revenue, you don't get to retroactively modify the contract. That's what performance bonuses are for. 
Nah she pays for it because she expects no expenses spared on the ring
Nah some lame bar but it’s in mammoth so it’s the lit place of the night 
Nah somebody overheard and complained upward 
Nah son baseball is way more lucrative for the average baseball player than the average football player. Agree rookie contracts are shit but the arbitration year money is good, and the late 20s money is huge relative to football 
Nah son he’ll be a keeper
Nah son I have a midrange paladin, ramp Druid, and mech zoo Mage that I'm comfortable with at level 10+. Then I have a handlock warlock and aggro shaman that I'm comfortable with at 13+
Nah son never forget you’re in the A tier of nations 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Nah son. This is literally just pasta and meat sauce 
Nah that has to be a troll 
Nah that’s about right 
Nah the assignment list comes out in April, then I will see what DC base billets are there, then I will rank them and find out my result in June 
Nah the fighters guild had that whole thing with the potion that made you super strong, then it turns out you hallucinate enemies and accidentally butcher a village, then go after the potion makers
Nah the rule is bad
Nah there are other apartments that cook better
Nah there’s no way it’s Wes welker 
Nah these people are fucking scum. I tried to negotiate and they just started yelling at me
Nah they want their own personal NFT 
Nah they’re solid
Nah this isn't mocking the homeless
Nah this was par for the course as long as I’ve seen and still is
Nah those are totally different. Pats had great route concepts, deep passes, and high scores. Eagles run basically the NFL equivalent of a double wing offense.
Nah we all have our unique styles 
Nah you can just run as a Republican 
Nah you're Theon
Nah, chans. 
Nah, put Wilson second.
Nah, Titans
Nahhh
Nahhh that’s cringey but fine

Named after Goody
Namely iirc, 1) he was a bad dude as judged by his peers at the time, 2) it’s hard to imagine somebody else landing in the new world and acting differently because that was the world at the time, 3) even if the most peaceful angelic person arrived instead, the disease would have been just as devastating

Nate Burleson is a quality talking head on CBS
Nate Diaz
Nate Silver also calls out Paul Krugman for being a hack lmao
Nate silver said the libertarians had a once in a lifetime shot in 2016, except they forgot to get a gun and instead were holding a banana
Nate Silver says “I’ve seen enough” in code. He’s wanted to call it for Biden for hours now.
Nate Silver says you need 6 points to be a contender. Alphas are 3, betas 2, gammas 1.
Nate Silver talked a lot about that during the campaign, basically that trump is so unprecedentedly "noisy" that the media has a very difficult time covering him saliently, and the big stories get lost amongst the little ones, even though the little ones would be big ones for any other president
Nate Silver talking like Biden has PA in the bag
Nate Silver talks about its strengths and flaws all the time. And they’ve committed to not making adjustments mid race, which is admirable, but might not yield the best results
Nate Silver tweeted that 538 is working on a new NBA player model, and hinted that MJ is actually underrated
Nate Silver tweeted today that he would guess a cookie cutter republican would be even with or beating Hilldog
Nate Silver’s model spat out 66-33 for Don on Monday. He’s also been writing for months that he thinks Biden needs to drop out, and he still thinks he should
Nate Silvers own idea was basically just to make the lottery weighting more even, so all the bottom teams have a more equal shot instead of the worst team having by far the best chance. Boring, but might work
Nate Washington

Navy ship commanders ship has Covid. He requests aid from the navy. He is unenthused by their response or lack thereof. He writes a 4 page letter to the navy, knowing/intending it will get leaked about the status of the crew. He’s relieved of command for going outside the chain of command and for lack of operational security.
Navy. Marine officers come from Annapolis only.

Neither, 23 and 22. Padres are 21.

Net neutrality doesn’t exist anymore 
Net neutrality gone. ISPs require you to pay for porn. Nobody does. Dating revives. Healthy relationships flourish. Society is saved. Ajit Pai saves America.  
Net neutrality is another good one. I'm pro net neutrality, but I can understand the argument that if Netflix accounts for 25% of total megabit transfer, they deserve to get more bandwidth
Net neutrality means that all websites get the same bandwidth from an ISP
Nets are the saddest team ever. Honestly they should sign gimmicky players and maximize entertainment for the next 2 seasons
Nets are the worst franchise in sports
Nets are the worst organization in sports

Ngl @#JustFacts✅ pretty disappointed you didn’t have #ASMB commentary about that post
Ngl 7 is up there
Ngl after Becker’s speech where he tried to get Marcus to say he loved him more than he loved his wife, nothing should surprise me
Ngl between Kyrie, the Twitter blue check shenanigans, the FTX meltdown, and the election, it’s been an extremely entertaining week of news
Ngl Chan I have been missing all of your jokes over the past several days
Ngl did not see the Cole Beasley-Nicki Minaj collab coming
Ngl don’t hate that bet
Ngl drafting MHJ and trading for FLB2 makes a lot of sense…
Ngl having Dave portnoy take any stance makes me support the opposite side
Ngl he’s got a point
Ngl I am more excited to see how fields performs simply because of Marcus 
Ngl I can name more people on the women’s US team than the men’s 
Ngl I did NOT see this “actually America joining WWI was bad” outflanking maneuver from Marcus coming 
Ngl I don’t remember any of these people 
Ngl I fear there’s a shot BC and Bama don’t even play in the same division in 2031
Ngl I feel like a real FLB rn
Ngl I fuckin love that commerical
Ngl I respect that 
Ngl I was flabbergasted when I found out lapointe is a distant cousin of marcus 
Ngl I was pretty close
Ngl I woke up this morning excited for a soccer game for the first time in my life. It was a new emotion for me. 
Ngl I’m extremely surprised
Ngl I’m surprised by both the acceptance of an 8 team league, as well as the commitment to our rules system that is unpalatable to many, as Jeff eloquently stated
Ngl I’ve never met anybody who considers CC even remotely in the same league as you do Frankie 
Ngl if TCU loses and 3/4 is OSU Bama I am going to laugh
Ngl if that’s tongue in cheek that’s fucking hilarious
Ngl it feels like a trap game
Ngl it just sounds like an excuse for women to post selfies of themselves 
Ngl it still boggles my mind how Trump was so so racist to Latinos and somehow made legit inroads with them (at least in Florida)
Ngl it’s a somewhat cool concept, but I cannot imagine a recruit committing, then seeing their team get relegated. The decommits and the Bud Light Transfer portal would be more active than ever
Ngl it’s about time
Ngl It’s not very fun giving 12 strokes when we play because the only time I win is when he blows up, and then it’s not fun
ngl its pretty ironic that he wrote the Sneetches but got cancelled because the plain-bellied Sneetches are too white
Ngl looks like Rusty Hardon has some solid rebuttals against several of the accusers
Ngl prob better for both of us that I lost
Ngl Taylor 100% ended up being the other girl in “you belong with me”
Ngl the 86 is the most impressive part of that
Ngl the FH history is truly both long and rich
Ngl the high school reading list has helped me immensely in jeopardy
Ngl the post could be worse
Ngl the US’s (eventual) Covid response with the vaccine distribution and fiscal policy, when viewed against that of rest of the world, has made me significantly more relieved than 6 months ago. I was genuinely worried that we were becoming Soviet-esque as a bureaucracy with no function. There are still clearly major problems, but compared to everyone else, we are currently lapping the field. 
Ngl this didn’t age great
Ngl tho Bruce Arians is reaping what comes from signing AB in the first place
Ngl tho the marketing for soccer in the US over the past 20 years has been very successful
Ngl tho there’s some moments where it might be a bit traumatic to read and shortly after bang your wife 
Ngl wearing your service dress every day and doing nothing but follow the president around seems like an awful job, especially for a flag officer
Ngl, probably would

Nick Foles contract is something weird. $27.5/5 years, but if he’s still on the eagles contract by Feb 2019, the final 3 years of the contract are automatically voided. So basically the eagles have until end of next year to trade him or he’s an FA.

No brainer
No but Anesto acknowledged his BC fam and personally welcomed us to anestos familia
No but Don has decided to attack DeSantis as a pedophile 🍿

No but I was on the computer when goodwin asked and looked it up
No but I went to bellarmine so same thing really
No but it makes you "appear" smart. That's the real goal

No but Julio was your most expensive
No but pls link I love that stuff
No but the flavor combo is not nearly popular enough for how good it is
No but the keeper thing majorly affected the deal
No but they werent the (projected) worst team in the league then
No but they're pretty sweet. A bit hard to control when you first get on but way more fun than a cart
No but why don’t Eu look Phor a job 
No but will be in a few days. In Caratunk now, just crossed the kennebeck ~30 mins ago
No but you can identify the position names
No career salary only
No charges. Apparently the answer was yes
No clue
No clue
No clue but Pat once called them the ice climbers from Super Smash and it was fucking perfect 
No clue but we all know anything “international” is a gigantic corrupt clown show
No clue if they still compete
No clue never been but anybody saying “nothing incentive” about a restaurant is a snob by definition 
No clue on six flags. Types of birds, or something.
No clue tbh, there is a whole bevy of flexible response options but I have no idea what the executive will choose
No clue. I don’t wanna do it. 
No clue. This is the defense he went with after months of foresight and opportunity to plan, but he’s clearly not a smart fella and maybe that defense is dumb even if it went according to plan
No clues
No college basketball team could even beat a D league team
No collusion and I want Diggs. Season is over for me anyway
No commitment 
No comparing Gesicki to Jonnu makes no sense to me
No correlation whatsoever, YET
No criminal record is hilarious considering all the criminals in the NFL
No cumboiz as commissioner. It’s a rule
NO DAMMIT FUCK
No dashes or Greek letters or anything
No Dave should’ve left him in since it was probably his last ever shot at a perfect game
No deduction. Innocent until proven guilty
No defense for Trump on this
No details yet. Just that it appears to be an attempted military coup.
No don't think warriors get it after last night
No double teams?? Hahaha old basketball is so dumb
No exceptions 
No excuses tho
No for real this is nuts. Iran will retaliate. This is some major major shit
No for real. Who else has a career and persona that mirrors tiger. Closest thing is Serena Williams IMO. Maybe MAYBE Brock Lesnar
No fucking shit Sherlock
No fucking way
No fucking way
No fucking way 
No gi is way better IMO. Not just cause I have a wrestling background, but gi is so nonfunctional in real life
No going back now. Happy birthday @Jamie Bourque huge gift from your brother here
No goodwin I had no opportunity because all the women were already snatched up or quit or lesbians by then
No half no
No He actually said he was sick of the fake news and bullshit that comes from a commune of circlejerkers who call themselves JustFacts
No he gave a big Ric Flair woo tho
No he just doesn’t like to see Andrew Abu Bekar rooting for the terrorists (and against the troops) yet again
No he just dropped out of the race. But I was curious if you knew who he was because you’d never heard of Klobuchar 
No he’s a beast
No he’s just trolling. Everybody can do Saturday at 8
No he's not he sucks
no horrible drop.  that's cut worthy
No I agree but Ukraine issued a general mobilization last week, aka you can’t leave 
No I agree. But I'm saying they'd built an offense that a QB could be his best at
No I also think that
No I come back in 3 weeks
No I didn’t. you’re saying one vote doesn’t matter, as if literally only one person would have that mindset and it would truly be inconsequential. I’m saying that’s stupid, and empirically proven literally last election 
NO I didn't drop it I'm swimming in a fucking ocean of it with 1000 paper cuts all over me
No I enjoy the farce
No I hated it. It had 1 decent song (black skinhead) and two redeemable songs (Bound 2, Blood on the Leaves). TLOP has 0 decent songs and like 4 songs you can pretend you like if you get really really high. 
No I just finished Ep 5
No I just walked a lot and drank a lot of beer
No I know it's official. I meant are you serious that this will actually impact his legacy?
No I made game winning diving catch on a shitty field. The Mexicans made piñatas of me
No I mean I’d do both lol
No i quoted the last line of the opening monologue in Halo 3
No I read it, I just can’t believe that THAT was the line
No I totally agree but I meant what is the story where that is relevant, preferably told by @The Big Dick Bandit or @#JustFacts✅ 
No I totally I get it. Especially when the masters winners are like -18 every year
No I want to prevent a feedback loop where apathetic and uninformed people vote for whoever promises them more shit
No I was referencing when Katelynn asked what NYE plans were
No I’m not
No I’m watching USC-Iowa
No idea how it is in winter tho
No idea I just saw it in my podcast feed this morning
No idea if legally that makes any sense but she should
No idea never heard of them
No idea to be honest. We've been in uncharted territory for a while, even without this latest report
No idea what bing bong is
No idea what's going on with the wieners tho
No idea. Figure they're all the same for my cases
No idea. He’s got a brother who is uninvolved in politics and a sister who is very involved, but a female leader seems unlikely. 
No idea. It’s all super classified
No idea. That's why this is so weird
No idea. This is all the NYT article says 
No illusions on that here. Still can’t believe we made that trade and pick. Probably cost us at least 1 Super Bowl
No im serious. Jordy was an integral part of that trade. And now all of a sudden future value is not legit 
No info on if they found anything salient, just that they found thousands of more emails
No it applies universally. I know what Joe means
No it blows
No it can’t take off
No it directly affects your life. Ever since the Russian invasion, the Tankie posts have all but disappeared 
No it doesn't though because it's worldwide revenue for the World Cups. Doesn't show how much USWNT made for US Soccer. 
No it doesn't. If literally any of us got doxxed by CNN, any Google of our names would instantly show the worst things we've ever said and done. It's not a balanced court of public opinion
No it was a @J. Francis Bourque study abroad joke
No it was dumb as fuck to sign them and that’s why you have a GM who can say “Lebron I get it but you’re being rash and stupid” 
No it will be defined by our 2022-23 Super Bowl season
No it’s 5/12 but I’m prob not gonna make it until late Friday actually
No it’s about claiming a certain handicap and then failing to shoot even close to it, despite the definition of a handicap
No it’s about helping the poors
No it’s better 
No it’s crazy. Fields is arguably the worst passer in the league. Predicting an MVP run is absurd.
No it’s drafts, but some games are different buy in $, and there are 3 ongoing that haven’t finished yet and therefore aren’t recorded
No it’s not. analysts have talked ad nauseum about this 
No it’s the MLB. Lots of affected Latinos 
No it's collapsing because they put all their resources into oil and used future expected earnings to give free shit to everybody. When the earnings underperformed, everything went to shit
No it's literally not lol that's it. That and the apprentice 
No it's saying 59% of people who identify as moderate support torture 
No Jeff that’s only if you take a trump university course 
NO JOE THATS FUCKING STUPID. THEY HATE YOU AND ME AND EVERYBODY NO MATTER WHAT
No John were not having Becker’s party in the Mariana Trench smh
No joke is that an upgrade from Big Ben
No joke these pickups are way more legit than OBJ for $1
No joke, I wonder what Allen Iverson would have to say about safe spaces and the SJW movement, considering he is likely a hero to many of them, and his whole persona was breaking the "safe space" that the NBA was imposing upon its players and viewers. 
No joke, last years Spurs gotta be up there
No joke, might be worse than the browns
No joke, wouldn't be too surprised to see 16-0
No joke: managing the 🐐/🐩 lists, keeping tabs on fantasy keepers trades and auction budget, and managing the survivor and spread picks pool is a more difficult job than half the jobs in my department
No just Marcus’ dad’s passion made me a temporary Auburn fan
No just that finance isn't stem. Read it wrong
No justice no peace! Fuck these racist ass police!
No leaving the east coast lol
No lies were told
No like what’s the difference in that type of job lol
No loans = no college for anybody who can’t afford it out of pocket
No lol
No longer with Accenture, don’t have anything lined up just yet but I’m not worried. Gonna move back home indefinitely and figure shit out
No love for BC’s own Kofi Kingston smh
No love for Section 80 or DAMN
No matter what he won’t outzest the (people’s) FLB 5
No minorities I see 🤔 
No money lost tho
No mostly from conservative blogs actually, but I do reference it a lot
No my AT days are over
No nah no nah 
No need
No need to bring McGwire into this
No need to execute those folks. We have the gulag for that exact reason 
"No no no
"
No no you're getting off topic. Were talking about how Barry bonds is the greatest baseball player of all time. 
No not excited for the Hamilton mixtape
No not my first time, but i think the first time I've done it at Newton Comm.  And I'm not sure I've ever broken 80 on a Par 72
No not really, but do secure the border
No not really. Like maybe once if I'm working with someone in the U.K. and want to know what they look like. But not really
No not the singer the starlet
No of course numbers aren't always right but in terms of comparing teams across decades, I have yet to see a better method
No one thing in particular, it just fits the lifestyle and personality that I know of Chris Chan
No only 1.5 years
No only because they would've come out already
No other takers? I'm actually very interested in hearing yalls responses. It's one of my favorite questions
No other terms
No other weekend songs 
No owners will sell 
No picture, yet...
No plans at the moment
No politician with a future is going to accept 
No prenup and I’m in
No prob bruh
no prob bud
No prob only for the first few weeks, if that. I mean we’re gonna have laptops so it’s possible I can even log into groupme lol. And phone privileges depend on the commandant. They say no social media but idk if groupme counts, like I know slack is allowed
No prob. Anytime you want to shit on Obama just give me a call ;)
No push it through 
No QB is ever surefire. I think the closest thing is “basically a lock that they’ll no no worse than a competent QB20”
No ragrets, I nominated the person who knows and cares most about BC football out of anybody I know
No real tldr, but the gist is that it's impossible without being draconian
No reason in particular, just sports talk. Rondo has a history of chemistry issues tho, right?
No rebuttal. I acknowledge the hypocrisy 
No reunion entries. 
No ride, can't go. Thanks anyway 
No running club?
No she probably couldn't get a job literally anywhere else
No shit Sherlock 
No short answer to that
No shot
No shot I’m ever going lower than 24
No shot they win 8 games tho
No Sleep??? Of all the wiz songs that’s the one? I mean it’s good but like I think I’d pick something else of his
No special guest 🤔 
No spoilers
No State money for anything that is anti LGBT 
No still just non binary at this point. Might go trans-kingdom in a later season tho
No still waiting on that but I wanted to do one and thought I'd sorta breeze through it. Lmfao
No striking. Grappling only, ends at the tap. Who says no?
No symptoms for a long while but he’s gotta constantly watch his diet and should be fine. Might need a transplant at some point in the future, like 10+ years 
No tengo adblock on the phone 
No texts but I might have them with my parents telling them the news that the landlord said it was fine
No thank you for reminding me
No thanks BB and co. Smart moves like knowing who to let walk due to comp picks. It’s a joke that there is still such an exploitable advantage just by knowing the rules, similar to simple clock management somehow being such an issue for teams. 
No thanks. But you should def take that bet if you’re “book it” confident 
No that letter is absurd
No that’s Andrea 
No that’s not it. It’s that the giants don’t have Barry Bonds or a 3 WS in 5 years dynasty
No that’s part of the point
No that’s the 5th card. It’s the Turn
No that’s the navy 
No that’s what I say when I play 2v2 StarCraft
No thats 100% unlocking...
No that's a sure net loss
No that's Jeff
No that's probably Becker
No the BCI folk
No the cowboys corner
No the fix is in is hilarious 
No the insurance company did. I hit my max
No the line was absurd
No the Niners are putting Jordan Howard on their back
No the one with the blue people
No there is a very real anti pats bias because the Pats have been dominant for 15 years
No they are significantly protected. Woj and Shams tweeted about it
No they probably shouldn’t have gotten in over the current 4 teams. But probably shouldn’t be laughed out of the top 6 teams, given they’ve done everything they possibly could have to prove themselves
No this has nothing to do with it
No this is from reviewing emails and slack messages and stuff 
No those are 10 afghans 
No TO was retarded
No trade him to the Giants
No trick answer like body language, tapping the person in front, right?
No vetos 
No video of the alleged solar eclipse 
No video unfortunately 
No Watt and yet Houston defense is still damn good, not factoring in strength of opponents 
No way
No way = 40% chance 
No way accepting payments for the blue check could instantly make the blue check worthless. Nobody could’ve predicted this
No way in hell it  was +700
No way in hell race helps him. The Stans will defend him no matter what and some of them will cal racism, but no way it helps. 
No way is @👀 in the top half
No way it’s a bet on TCU
No way it's all perfectly legal. You could throw the book at him for lots of stuff, and hundreds already have
No way it's real right? How did he make it I wonder
No way left called it off
No way mahomes, Ekeler is borderline, and how does one join this league?
No way man 245 pounds with a six pack and 4.4 speed, didn't you read the hashtags?!??
No way my country isn’t the best of these by far. Access to both oceans, farmland, and oil
No way Seattle takes less than 3 firsts plus right?
No way that girl went to BC right? She’d never be able to show face again
No way that is accurate. MD is def the highest
No way that’s true
No way the Bourque bros aren’t  already millionaires
No way the lions get in over the bears 
No way they have a backup kicker right?
No way they overturn that
No way this is accurate
No way up
No way, keep talking Kyrie, tell us all about the chemtrails and the faked moon landing and how jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams
No way. Lebron would take one look at each army and just have a feeling that the Americans would pull off the upset
No way. Those guys are fast as hell and deadly in open space. Edelman runs mostly short routes. 
No wayyy
No wayyy it's not like these guys are gonna start being power hitters. Most drastic effect is fly out guys hitting more homers
No wayyyyyyyy
No we don't 
No went from Amarillo straight across Oklahoma 
No who would beat who’s ass
No wonder nobody trusts scientists 
No wonder the Union is a screeching dumpster fire, it’s led by five women
No wonder you're not getting paid
No you always root for your team to win. Rooting for your team to lose to get a pick or some shit is a beta libcuck move
No you don’t 
No you don't. Lie and say you're a sql wizard. The interviewer won't know shit. 
No you have to hold the Beatdown in Beantown over my grave
No you should laugh that the president and Rob Kardashian basically tweeted the exact same thing today 
No you tip movers because they’re ex cons and in full control of your stuff 
No you’d just need the ball for the spot
No you’d rather have $10
No you’re just being a butthole 
No you're not don't lie
No! You've been there with me!! -B
NO!! The media was sooooo light on him during the primary. Now that it's the general election, they've only recently started to ramp up the attacks
No, and wrong direction 
No, because he's a beast and a pro bowler and an integral part of a great defense?
No, because nobody knows any baseball players, because the MLB can’t market for shit
No, but he likes to go on early morning Twitter rampages so we’ll see. My bet he just calls it fake news 
No, but I can throw a dodgeball at >10 mph within 3 feet of a target which is more than half of these clowns. 
No, but I’d imagine he wouldn’t post a 1200 word essay on Facebook about it
No, but they broke protocol and there was an outbreak, so...
No, flying commercial to SC. Then I have to sit there for a week because the mil flight doesn’t come for another week. 
no, I have never talked to a girl in my life. Why do you ask?
No, I was waiting for consensus on what people wanted
No, if KC wins, Kevin and goody tie you, which I literally just said
No, it's to prevent collusion
No, more just because absence of a worse starter
No, pen and paper tallies haha
No, suppose tm night is possible then
No, thank you Scott Hanson, for serving our country for 7 hours every Sunday. You are an honorary the troops. 
no, thankfully
No, yes, HAH, no
No, you can figure it out
No, you see a goat door open after your first pick
No. All the way down at 85 👀 
No. But FYI he’s the right wing grifter who has a history of concocting smear schemes that hilariously backfire
No. But she did complain about the BOGO50 deal was so hard to correctly put into the order system 
No. Deployments are only a year max, usually 3-6 months 
No. Even Peterson is gonna get beat 1v1 half the time
No. Goodwin still has LM powers and vetoed the trade, hence the gif 
No. I don’t know anything not reported by the media right now
No. I suggested it but zero people wanted to
No. I watched the live stream yesterday, nothing of substance. They didn’t show any angles other than exactly nose on
No. I’d probably survive it if I had to tho. Tough to tell how steep it is after that absurd very first part
No. I’ve never been there only know the reputation is that it can be dirty and overrun by homeless. What do the posts say?
No. It was a heavily redacted case with a buzz-worthy headline that people chose to cling on to because orange man bad. 
No. League members only. 
No. Literally just QB comp rate on that distance throw vs average for all QBs, aggregated
No. Much (most?) of the country is Christian as heck
No. No rules anomalies actually
No. Still put odds at around 75%
No. The situation recently  has been very… frustrating
No. There are barely even bugs. 
No. Too many good teams QBs sit in week 17
No. Ukraine has no incentive to truce. They are winning and would get nothing in return, probably betting that Russia would just reinvade again in 5 years. The key factor is if the US stops sending armament, then it’s possible their momentum slows significantly and they’d be forced to settle for a truce. 
No. You root for your home teams. 
No?
No? Che cosa?
Nobody (including in that article by apparently a BU hack) is saying academics are the reason
Nobody answered my last question
Nobody as clinched
Nobody can blow a game like the giants
Nobody can elicit the laugh/cringe like Steven Wu 
Nobody cares about a combined perfect game
Nobody commented on my power rankings :(
Nobody could possibly support it and retain their intellectual consistency
Nobody does
Nobody else has life threatening wounds, thank god
Nobody else is a walnuts fan I guess
Nobody ever changes
Nobody ever paid me for winning the “first to bang a 2000s girl” contest 
Nobody ever said he was a bad teammate
Nobody has
Nobody has gotten the hype like Mariota or Winston got, but I've read a few things about Prescott from Miss St, Hogan from Stanford, and Goff from Cal looking like future NFL quarterbacks
Nobody has to outbid them. The colts just don’t have to commit to him for a Tua-type contract. They could try get a veteran, or trade up, or tag him and go for a 2027 draft pick
Nobody hates Latino immigrants like recently arrived Latino immigrants 
Nobody here unbuttons but goes through the boxer hole, right?
Nobody in particular. I haven’t watched a footy game all year
Nobody in the NFL has a higher “joy brought to the FH per play” than the Zap Cannon
Nobody in trumps inner circle is going to be indicted anytime soon if at all, so it’s small potatoes 
Nobody is a digimon guy
Nobody is arguing with the phase 1a decision: nursing homes and frontline healthcare workers. The 1B is where is starts to get shifty
Nobody is being hurt because they don't get shit now lol. It can't possibly be worse for the athletes
Nobody is wearing the yellow?! Fkn zoomers 
Nobody knows because there may not have been the outbreak
Nobody knows that because they tagged him
Nobody knows what the conversation was between the navy brass and the Captain, so that’s the key missing piece to see if his decision to write the letter was warranted. 
Nobody mastered weak contact like him ever. nobody has ever even come close i don’t think
nobody reads it anyway, even when they do request them
Nobody said anything if they did. The proctor looked at me kinda weird tho
Nobody says shut about the shortened season a few years ago
Nobody should ever do an actual thoughtful analysis of their work
Nobody should take her seriously as a legitimate voice
Nobody trades anyway lol
Nobody turning on the manning cast for you
Nobody wants to hear about your other leagues in here 
Nobody was more heartbroken than this poor guy
Nobody was. Germans did it first. Russians never even got around to it
Nobody went to undergrad twice so its really impossible to accurately compare how you would’ve felt
Nobody who cares about football has talked about kaepernick in years
Nobody who heard was Accenture. So Goldman told Accenture that I was racist and Accenture HR called me. I told them it was a caricature. They all thought I was gonna be fine (boss, HR, etc) but the MD head of the Goldman relationship made the decision 
Nobody would be whining if it was OBJ who has zero value this year
Nobody’s mentioned maz yet but it’s understood 
Nomad wasn't even the best right handed hitter on the team!
Nomar damn talk about a lucky first round matchup for him. Let us not forget that the sox had all the pieces to win in 2003, but they couldn't finally break the curse until they LET GO of Nomar. Nomar = Cursed confirmed; Andrew Jackson = 🐐
Nomar shoutout!!
Nomar was also a dodger and therefore a piece of shit. No dodger will ever get my vote as anything 🐐
Nomar was an above average player who had a cult following because he was white
Nomar with the safety!!
Nominating anyone to the supreme court is a big deal, doesn't matter if it's trump obama whatever. It's still not confirmed, senate has to approve, and dems can filibuster. Idk about the second part
Nomination deserves rescinding 
Non athlete 
Non fan
Non goodwin and emyrs, any more guesses on the 24B ladies?
Non grad school crew grows smaller every day
non keeper leagues are more fun IMO
Non meme answer, Gut says @Ayatollah “Jar Jar” Thompson 
Non PPR is for butts up cheaters
Non sarcastic shocked face
Non serious answers smh
None of these are like life altering, but there are some damn good ones. Has to do a 12 month pin up calendar photo shoot, has to go out with the league wearing a fedora and cannot refuse a drink, has to eat at the same Olive Garden for every meal for a week straight, has to do an open mic stand up set... 
None of those are egregious. I’d take Lawrence, Hurts, Ryan over him. Maybe fields, Tua, Jameis 
None of us picked shoe string
None of you fuckers better be eating lamb or beef thighs for dinner tn
None on offense, none on defense. 
Non-full swing shots and putts are where he really struggles, which makes sense to me
Noon to 10
Nooo the cool marine pilot chick lost :(
Noooo
Noooo dammit
Noooo the content is too good
Nooooo totally not true. OBJ is more hype than substance, all about the spotlight and the flash, and is a little bitch. Jordy is perennially underrated, Jordy is a grinder, Jordy is about results on the field, not the spotlight. Jordy is a beam of light in an otherwise black cloud. 
Nooooooo
Nooooooo
NOOOOOOOO
Noooooooo 😢 
Nooooooooo
Noooooooooooo
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Nope didn’t see it god as my witness thanks for having my back god
Nope goodwin is not in the league. Can’t change the rules when the wind is blowing your way, then it hurts even more when it blows the other way 
Nope he's gonna have 73 yards, one for each of Barry bonds 2001 home runs
Nope I got goofed. Fake RT
Nope I got onboarded to this AmEx project, that photo is my AmEx badge
Nope I'm gonna hit the bench gleefully. I've been chargeable for 18 months lol, not too worried about that
Nope just an A+ reference

Not  low key at all. Extremely high key
Not "very strong", but much more than reasonable doubt
Not 100% sure but I think the latter, especially bad while maintaining that your unbiased
Not a bad BC commercial there. First time I'd seen it
Not a bad guess actually. But Chandler is better than this guy

Not a huge fan of blue cheese really. Even the fancy Gorgonzolas 
Not a lot as in petty revenge, a lot as in orchestrate mcdaniels to literally accept a role and then back out
Not a lot of easy lines in the draft this year smh
Not a lot of opportunities to make this reference. Had to capitalize 
NOT a loyal FH mode
Not a podracer sorry
Not a political expert. Every president appoints the heads of agencies to his pleasure, idk exactly where ICE fits in but yeah doesn't alarm me nearly as much as his general incompetency and bad decision making 
Not a problem ;)
Not a scientist/doctor disclaimer, but the running expectation is that Covid becomes “endemic” and is basically the new flu, correct?
Not a single time ever once
Not a terribly insightful or predictive article tbh, but provides solid context and a historical lens
Not a ton. The war in concentrated in the northeast around a town called Izyum. Mariupol in the southeast coast continues to be surrounded but it looks increasingly unlikely the Russians will commit to the urban warfare that is required to seize the town block by block. The biggest story is probably Amount and quality of the US munitions being supplied to Ukraine which have been extremely effective (and the lack of EU supplies).
Not a Vince Vaughn guy
Not against balsamic, against thinking balsamic on ice fucking cream is a normal thing to do 
Not all heroes wear capes (sometimes they wear lab coats)
Not all his fault of course. But that last drive he blew 2 easy passes and went 3 and out
Not all of us get standing ovations when we wear our letter jackets to high school football games
Not all the way in, but in for the one game a week 
Not American aircraft 
Not an easy one but come on devers at least knock it down
Not any significantly more than 2 days ago when I posted here
Not April fools 
Not Arizona...
Not as a singleton mig29 against su-35s lol
Not as bad as the Turkish lira tho
Not as cool as this guy
Not as many as I thought. But during the national anthem these 2 guys in Kap jerseys kneeled. I laughed
Not as many as Joe in late 2018
Not as safe as I feel in the Fuckswoles
Not ask dumbass questions like "do you want to remain in the league"
not at all actually. trevor watched it and started playing and challenged me, so i started playing
Not awful takes
Not bad at all
Not bad at the tackle, but he was carted off...
Not bad by any means but yeah below monsters inc, which was my close 6
Not bad early speculation with realistic scenarios^
Not bad!!
Not bad, wedding was a great halfway break, if not necessarily relaxing. 
Not barbaric if you're white. Chan though, really?
Not Becker's hand confirmed. 
Not being able to play FanDuel is crushing. And yes I tried VPN
Not being an election denier is a core policy preference of mine
Not best ball. Best score per hole
Not big truss 
Not Boston
Not Boston but Zillow Rentals app was my favorite
Not Bruce castor lmao
Not close to the same thing. Disrespecting the flag is saying fuck all to the progress we've made.
Not college material. 
Not comfortable with this posted right after the Third Reich book
Not coming to Stowe thanks for the invite 
Not cool mr Hankey got killed off
Not directly related but my uncle is a restaurant franchise financier and he makes fkn cake 
Not dissimilar from what Obama did with Fox News in 2009
Not Drachman me or Chan, but Goody and the big guy 
Not during sexy times
Not Elway is it
Not enough clearly
Not enough floppy wieners for me
Not enough, and even fewer LTs, and even fewer single LTs
Not entirely sure. If I play in NJ but have my address in NY, I'm not sure if I can get the payout. I do know though that I wouldn't be able to access the app from within an NY IP address, even if i live somewhere else
Not even a bad play call. Just terrible execution by mattison
Not even about America, for America?
Not even American water 
Not even any Roe V Wade takes?
Not even cutting edge ideas... Like all of these things already exist
Not even gonna bite the Trump will be half decent troll bait
Not even gonna post any of my classic LOL puns? Smh
Not even gonna start with Herbert but I’m still a TLaw believer
Not even kidding though lol
Not even mad at the trade just LOLZING at that logic 
Not even meant Adam insult
Not even that close
Not even trolling: playing Call of Duty or similar video games is working on split second decision making
Not fight, box
Not finish the term, including resigning 
Not fixing that typo 
Not for free. But Shanahan offensive designs with a non-statue QB could be lit, plus it’s not like Jimmy G is a stud deep ball passer. Worst case, it’s a cheap backup to improve on Mullen’s.
Not fun fact: they did find WMDs in Iraq - a whole Arsenal of chemical weapons. But they didn't want to publicize that too much because that would go against the circle jerk
Not gonna lie manny machado to the dodgers is not what I had in mind as a bday present
Not gonna lie NR’s characterization is a lot closer to accurate than the LA Times comparing her to Tank Man at Tiananmen 
Not gonna lie that 9 game win streak looks way less impressive in hindsight 
Not good enough to win a mug apparently
Not great bob
Not great for the Ners
Not great with white meat tho. Great in salads and with red meat
Not having a center is weird 
Not his fault. He’s literally shaking with rage
Not if chief has anything to say about that 
Not if he’s Native American 
Not if the QB sucks lol
Not if there’s no buy in because the winner is gaining and the losers lose nothing
Not if we die early
Not in the LM note
Not in the sink I didn’t
Not in this groupme lmao
Not in top 100 thank god
Not including playoffs
Not intentionally. More just don’t need to cut my hair because I wear a hat everyday because I don’t have to work 
Not Isaiah Thomas tho
Not Jeffrey Toobin
Not jumping at the opportunity tbh
Not just college sports, all of college
Not just human history, but huwoman and huchildren history too
Not just polarization though. If that were the case you'd expect Hillary and Trumps green bars to be higher
Not like he was tho. Buddy’s seen some shit at Lake Laogai
Not like it was a mystery that he was a fickle, whiny, demanding prima donna 
Not mad at that. Missed throws happen.
Not mad, but it was a good reason to spring the conversation. Btw the tally is up to 5-3 in favor of FAs, so unless Emz Marcus and Jaime all want waivers, no change
Not mariota obsessed, but i think he’s been better this year than the guys I listed. His efficiency has been ok, but he only throws 15-20 times a game
Not meant to be a criticism, just interested
Not missing much IMO. Great artwork and animation, but a bit weak of a story
Not my first rodeo
Not necessarily to call people I’ve never met tankies, but I’ll call it an added bonus
"Not necessarily. I think a ton of Russian citizens see this war as justified, and are willing to suffer for it. Just like Americans didn’t blame FDR for the hardship WWII. 

What percentage of the Russian population? No idea, which is a key question. "
Not now but in for Starcraft in the future 
Not now Chris can’t you see she’s in the middle of a game? 
Not now Marcus
Not now. It’s the absolute worst time to buy, mortgages are high, prices haven’t dropped, and markets are trash so I’d have do liquidate at lows
Not ok you pervs
Not on hand, I'd have to look.  But overall I'm all about bottom up, local level planning and decision making for everything, including infrastructure, as opposed to the Stimulus Package style "throw money at shit and hope something comes out"
Not on the registry 🤔 
Not once, but TWICE 
Not one with her name on it ;)
Not only a QB guru, but a ball ripping guru as well
Not only did he live, he saved his marriage
Not only did he not follow back, he didn’t even accept my follow request 
Not only did it violate the CBA, the hospital told them it would violate the CBA ahead of time lmfao 
Not only that, but Becker was so scared of starting 2025 with a crushing golf defeat to the troops that he purposely excluded me from a golf outing in my home city 
Not opposed
Not our fault your typos are somehow always extremely sexual 
Not paying taxes on it. That’s literally it. I would reinvest in the SP immediately
Not pending anything *
Not possible to be locked in on that game
Not possible to get season tix anymore is it? All individual
Not possible. I have an immunity there
Not prince of Monaco smh
Not puke but do the run and do it well enough
Not quite
Not quite (I’ve risked more than $450) but it effectively guarantees I’ll be in the black
Not quite an engineering college but I think that's a very good academic investment
Not quite but it is a nice bonus feature 
Not quite but they rallied back from 3-0 to game 7 only to get their cheating ass hearts broken
Not quite double down saloon absurd, but still absurd
Not quite. I’d applied long before that incident 
Not reading that hack job Deadspin article, but Jeff did it mention anything about her being thrown on the pile of guns??
Not really
Not really he has the most but he's spent a ton already. And I don't think this is a resurgence for either Kasich or Trump long term. They're not polling nearly as well anywhere else, and both targeted NH over Iowa a long time ago. 
Not really in the scope
Not really tbh
Not really, I don’t think the heckling really happens outside of 16. The big cheers do though
Not really. I was in a cab coming back from somewhere with Chloe and Big Tittied Red Headed Bitch, and Zink is complaining to Chloe all ride that she paid for someone on the way there, and didn't want to pay on the way back, so she was already pissed off. Then we pull into BC and she angrily swings open the door and trips getting out and eats it. Chloe is asking if she's alright but not really. She storms off screaming. Hilarious
"Not really. More like steals are not replaceable; other stats are. 

Like, Player A gets 30 points a game. If he wasn't on the team, it's not like the team would score 30 fewer points a game. More likely is Player B would score those 30 points instead (or they'd be distributed, etc)

That doesn't work with steals. If Player A gets 5 steals a game, and all of a sudden he's traded, the team WOULD have 5 fewer steals a game."
Not recent but I remember like 5 years ago hearing that Brandon Tate was going to be the next Randy Moss
Not saying he had it in the bag lol just a hypothetical 
Not saying I deserve the Medal of Honor, but not saying I don’t deserve it either
Not saying it's enough, but it's significant
Not saying it's not fair, just that it sucks for the unknown Mexican guy who's top 5 in his weight class
Not saying we absolutely should but the cause and effect is unquestionable 
Not seeing any pink 
Not sue if you can tell but it's snowing sideways. They closed all the roads
Not super juicy but I’ll take it
Not sure about that... Makes headlines for sure, but shows weakness and questions the apolitical toughness he's built his brand on. Also, Cruz has already been spinning that is shows Trump doesn't care about Iowa voters, or at least takes them for granted
Not sure all the details yet. But they play OB/lost ball as red hazards which I’m not a huge fan of
Not sure but I don’t have a return ticket so anything is possible
Not sure exactly how this stuff works
Not sure exactly. Well be in Stratton on Friday. Maybe try to do a slack pack from there to the 100 mike wilderness or something. Then try to power through the wilderness in like 4 days
Not sure he has the budget for that, probably should table that discussion for now
Not sure how denouncing the nazis became a trope but I’m here for it
Not sure how I feel about us all opening our secret orders the night before Jan 6 🤔 
Not sure how real this is but worth sharing anyway
Not sure how you could criticize the Pats for this when they literally just had a black HC
Not sure I have read access to that document
Not sure I’d wager bottom half in QBR, but definitely not top third
not sure if /s but isnt it "afterwarddddds"
Not sure if I should be proud or mad
Not sure if it’s a parody but I guarantee buying ads in video games would backfire spectacularly 
Not sure if it’s Wednesday, let’s give it a 2 day vote to confirm
Not sure if real but:
Not sure if serious
Not sure if that means I'm slow or you're surprised, but yeah I'd watch until she gets eliminated lol 
Not sure if that’s a bicep curl, a shrug, or a one arm row
Not sure if trolling anymore
Not sure if trolling...
Not sure if trolling... But one would hope those in charge of domestic policy also have extensive knowledge about their area
Not sure what the billionaire mod is, but sounds like the same fight.
Not sure what the problem is? Also unrelated but Scheffler dominating out there, currently 14 or under
Not sure what you mean Marcus but Sanders won 151.5K to 95K in NH, 60.4% to 38.0%
Not sure what you’re talking about jeff 
Not sure why I’m tagged but I did love that rant
Not sure why telling emyr a hilarious joke is such a funny picture
Not sure why they’re calling it the Raider when we all know it’s called the Flying Dorito
Not sure yet
Not sure yet. Ramstein or yokota are supposed to be awesome. But I’d love hulburt field too. Cannon is supposed to be the worst base in the whole Air Force, so as long as I don’t get there lol
Not sure you understand how a fight card works 
Not sure. Assume it means % of the money assigned to the position, of the whole pool of Top 10 players at each position
Not sure. I'm at Accenture office now. Project just sold on Friday (I was actually part of the pitch for some dumb reason) so we're still getting the team together.
Not sure. It’s quite unexpected 
Not sure. Might be a fit on the redskins tho
Not sure. Speculation that it's due to Erdogan becoming increasingly Islamic and also ruthless on domestic protests, especially secular ones.
Not sure. The mass media seems to think so, and if he stalls then his momentum will be a big talking point. Whether or not the voters will care is a different issue. Polls following Saturday's debate haven't shown any movement, but who knows because polls have sucked ass so far
Not sure? I know it's one of them cities
Not surprised
Not surprised coming from a guy who never ran further than 8 yards deep
Not surprised Jeff only acknowledges the most liberal places in the country and everything else is dead to him
Not surprised tbh. The core belief of leftism is anti-Americanism and everything else is secondary
Not surprised the elitist doctors look down on the backbone of America while they whine about their low pay
Not surprised. The 90s were the Steroid Era of the enterprise tech solutions industry
Not surprising coming from a lawyer, defending the CCP
Not taking a side I just know nothing about either medicine or law
Not technically a title. After MD it's just more senior MDs
Not terribly surprised tbh. I feel like you can be decent and play some holes perfectly, but get horribly punished by small mistakes 
Not that anybody would just know that off hand lol. But if not then you could definitely do some hilarious shit with them
Not that I know of. Only “no foul play suspected”
Not that I’m aware of. Connor would probably know one or two
Not that it changes your mind, but Twitter has banned lots of people before
Not that it's even their own fault. But they're real strong for the first half plus, the offense has scored <7 points, then they give up a 3rd down big play and it's curtains from there
Not that one but you’re very close 
Not that you’re gonna change, but if you wanted to save $800 you could get a PC and Android instead of MacBook and iPhone 
Not the hook up I was looking for...
Not the most, a majority
Not the tush push but pretty close 
Not to mention anti amnesty was literally the main thing he campaigned on
Not to mention they’re missing 3 players including a top DL
Not to mention your jizz might freeze
Not to my knowledge @Matt Levine’s Parrot. Space force has been in the works for a long time, as the USAF global space command. Trump was just the guy in office when the administrative switch happened. And the DoD thinks it’s a good idea, and I agree with them.
Not to say he’s not friends with them, just they didn’t make the cut
Not today
Not tonight but I’ll be around starting Sunday 
Not too many seasons you draft CMC and Saquon only to lose them both in 2 weeks
Not Trent Richardson bad, but still is at best a middling RB
Not true goody you can make your boobs smaller by lifting
Not true I just don’t partake
Not true. Never with you
Not trying to be a jerk just genuinely curious 
Not trying to counter your point but never thought of that before
Not Tucker kraft 
Not uncommon at all. I always Google as soon as I don't know how to do something
Not unless one of you blue falcons me
Not unless the koolaid man has connotations I’m not aware of
Not very good lol. Don't regret it but if/when I do it again, I'll know what to expect this time.
Not very much. There are other conflicts we are far more focused on 
Not watchable? Hey man dozens of people disagree
Not watching but, it’s pretty sad Biden-Harris don’t have a real answer for the court packing question
Not what I expected, but I’ll take it
Not what we’re looking for here
not when it's 96... if the ball slips it would be 92-93 at most
Not with that attitude!
Not with the 16 games caveat
Not without Becker’s buy in
Not working for me. Shame because I missed 24 hours of FH content
Not worried. The big dick bandit will steal them in transit
Not worst, most extreme. everything is either 0 or 100 with them. On every topic 
Not worth it lol
Not wrong. I basically wrote the Three Musketeers. 
Not yet
Not yet
Not you dumbass the braggart
Not your hand eh
Not your other mans (Marcus)
Not. Even. Close. 
Noteworthy that ners and bengals both won the late season matchups 
Nothin like Dartmouth and tufts men flexing their college football resumes 
Nothing Becker loves more than reminding people of their failures
Nothing Becker loves more than telling others he’s part of something and they’re not invited 
Nothing cements American cultural dominance like bringing NFL games to Europe, them all selling out, and the Europeans bellowing out American songs in between plays. 
Nothing gets by frank
Nothing gets Joe going like grad school interview details 
Nothing gets past BCEagleEyes222
Nothing is more fuckholes than not caring about the league, then chirping about a literally pointless matchup
Nothing like coming home and being greeted by my favorite college 
Nothing like coming home to a Giants 10th inning comeback Buster Posey walk off on the first day home
Nothing like crushing a few airport beers in uniform
Nothing like spending the night judging black men on MLK day
Nothing locked in yet
Nothing lol just two twenty something's pushing and kissing and giggling and teasing and kicking each other for 6 hours straight
Nothing lol. I do that every day, give or take. We do a lot of airstrikes.
Nothing nvm no bet 
Nothing specific, just you are totally George Costanza
Nothing was worse than seeing a bunch of trash options and having to settle for the precooked grilled chicken on the far right
Nothing will ever beat Belmont = Solid Mid Major
Nothing will ever top Rob gronklmaoski
Nothing would’ve been funnier than showing up late with Starbucks for everyone
Nothing wrong with that age gap 
Nothing, and I don't see a way to prevent it either. I mean look at the Big 4 all realizing they can create a consulting division no problem. Their business models aren't different
Nothing, I’m just a dick. They’re required to salute me, I’m not required to return it 
Nothing, she was just so unbelievably dumb. Like blonde joke, in one ear out the other dumb. Reminded me of one of my roommates from NYC, decently attractive but so airheaded at first glance that it made her unattractive 
Nothing. Also apparently there is a ceasefire agreement in Gaza
Notice how it doesn’t say “in the Latino community”
Notice the lack of "FAKE NEWS" outcries
Notice the part of the sentence that starts with “Despite”
Nov 27, Pats @ Jets, I'm getting tix for $155 for Lower End Zone through a JPMC deal. Anybody interested?
Nova by 15
Now all you mass holes are obligated to vote Rubio
Now Big Meat has been hit by a ransom ware attack. If this is enabled by Bitcoin then I am anti Bitcoin 
Now comes the DUI, coke problems and steroid busts
Now Darrow is my best friend
Now give me some damn medical advise you quacks
Now he did a pointless challenge and a unnecessary TO there
Now he's questioning himself and so is the team/fans going into game 7. And if Chapman can still pitch just th  same and he stands by his decision, what's the downside? 
Now I don’t blame little Becker for waiting for that entry level CEO job
Now I know her last name lol
Now I know what they mean when they say Being poor is a state of mind
Now I live in Alamogordo New Mexico and make $40k 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 
Now I want to throw up again
Now I will know for sure whether I made the biggest mistake of my life, or saved $2
Now I’ll never forget it at least
Now if I recall correctly, Becker initially claimed that Laxatives Murray would be a top 10 RB at season's end. In that regard, he is correct. Unfortunately for him, he was goaded into betting his $50 that Murray would finish top 8. And just as he missed out on the playoffs by a mere 1.6 points, he also missed lost this bet by a mere 6.6 points. Needless to say, this has been an unlucky sequence of events for our hero, putting him down $100 to the newcomer. All that remains now is the Tennis Ball of Justice, and once that is done, our hero can be reborn from the ashes like the magnificent phoenix he is.
now im all salty dammit goodwin
Now I'm all up in Goldman Sachs like these niggas tryna hold me back! These niggas tryna hold me back!
Now I'm confused
Now I'm hungry for two pizzas
Now I'm thinking which pornstars I would invite to my lotto winning sex party
Now is your time to send him a personal email and say “I’m sorry for my union’s shenanigans”
Now it feels like 80%
Now it’s fair or something 
Now it’s Rosen time
Now John Legend has entered the ring. I love it
Now push the damn trade through
Now saying shotgun to the back. Doesn’t look good. Attacker in custody 
Now that is #dedication
Now THAT is a hot take
"Now that it’s not gonna happen, what does the league think of this trade:

Adams $27 next year
CMC + TY"
Now that it's dead in the water, watch Asia make their own FTA and the US will be hurt even more
Now that Jacob Wohl is out of the picture, I need a new hysterical right wing grifter to adore
Now that that's settled, anybody talk to Vinny?
Now that the PKs are over, we need a new FH athletic event to look forward to
Now THAT was all time 
Now THAT would be a good use of the time machine
Now that’s a guy I am not looking forward to seeing
Now THATs a bet I would take
Now that's a good 🔥 take!
"Now the Red Sox have a Sale Price
( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼"
now THIS is a hilarious twist
Now watch him be next years Devonta Freeman and Becker will say "Rawls! I told you so!" And I'm finna be like "whoa whoa whoa nahhhh bruh you didn't"
Now we have to rely on Ezeli and afroflops to outboard max contract Thompson
Now we're talking
Now we're talking
Now we're talking!
Now you can make fun of me
"Now you got me thinking. Top 10 current female athletes by popularity

"
Now you have to say who
Now you just have to drink a twelve pack, eat 18 doughnuts, and jerk off 24 times and you've done it!!
Now you know how I felt managing Soy Sauce Oreo last year
Now your poor memeing skills will lead to your downfall. I'm more confident now
Now you're only missing 28
Now you're smeagol from LOTR?
Now, many are saying things look good for trump
Nowadays a bunch of hipsters would say hey man that's not cool and direct you to the nearest boutique coffee shop
NQR between Times Square and World Trade, to maximize the audience being tourists. You make $5 a car which is a ~1 minute stop. That’s $300 an hour. So even if you make wayyyy less than that and panhandle for wayyyyy less time, the odds are in your favor.
NRO, Reason, RedState, marginal revolution, some WSJ articles
Nuclear option was for nominees only I think. Becker's actually correct here that there was some special condition that allowed for filibuster bypass, but idk what it is without googling
Nude selfies, claims he can run a 4.3 (dropped another .1 seconds), a story about his exgf accusing him of stealing money so he logically strips down butt naked to prove he didn’t, the whole 9 yards
Number of fat fuckers who claim to have a foot injury to get out of PT for like 5 years
Number of voters minds changed due to this debate: over/under 5
Number one bring the H bomb
Nunez still being a great giant
Nut job is the wrong term. Just a hard right winger. 
Nvm found them
Nvm i meant Kevin’s
nvm lol I don’t care that much 
Nvm then lol
Nvm then lol 
Nvm thought that was Marcus tagged
Nvm. I can put Golladay on IR. we’re good
NY and LA are such posers
NY and MA voters should be registered D for the same reason 
"NY baseball has:
Mets fans, generally cool 

Yankees fans from Bronx (Puerto Rican) and NJ/Staten Island (Italian), die hard but insufferable

Yankees fans from NJ and CT who are fine and normal but rarely go to games

Bandwagoners in Manhattan

Hipsters in Manhattan and Brooklyn who have made hating sports a core personality trait."
NYC and LI says heroes. Ive never heard anybody else say that
NYC Bagel and Coffee House in Astoria is top of the bagel shop power rankings
NYC happy hour brings beer prices from like $8 to $6 so we don't really have it either
NYC is tough to parse because you have so many different groups
NYC shootings have risen 50% in Jan-Jun 2020 vs 2019, and nearly tripled in July 2020 vs 2019
"NYC teams power rankings by fandom:

Mets: best fans, stuck in queens
Jets: die hard fans, angry people
Yankees: die hard fans exist, but vast majority fair weather fans
Giants: second fiddle despite being better, fair weather fans
Rangers: pretty good I guess?
Knicks: fashion show
Nets: wannabe fashion show
Islanders: more like IsLOLnders"
NYC Twitter is discussing their longest walks and mine was from your apartment to stone street so I wanted to see 
NYG under 7 wins for $50
Nyheim Hines RB1
NYT has become absolute trash tho it’s true
NYT has trump at >95% winning Florida 
NYT's own Bret Stephens wrote a piece criticizing the project like a month ago.  He explains it much better than I could.
O Holy Night is epic. Could be in the LOTR soundtrack
o.O
Oakland is America’s team
Oakland is losing the Raiders, probably about to lose the Warriors, and has only the As left. Damn.
OAN is borderline Alex Jones territory 
OAN is like Alex Jones or QAnon. I’d be worried if my coach was a QAnon person 
Oatmega bars are okay. 200 calories, low fat, fill you up, but taste pretty meh
Obama is "to blame" for supporting the FSA in the first place who is basically al qaeda. Then he made a big dick statement with the "red line" on chemical weapons, following it up with a little dick backdown and lost the worlds trust in americas word. At this point there's really nothing we can do, but I do think we should be arming Kurdistan more significantly, even though that has its own problems with how Turkey will view the US
Obama is a perfect example of someone who came into office with those idealistic aspirations and quickly realized that the world doesn’t give a shit
Obama knows this. I actually think Hillary knows this too but refuses to acknowledge so because she said she's against it to acquiesce the Bernie bros.
Obama murdered children! And also he is in the pocket of the JOOOOOOS
Obama tried to play nice. Look where that got us
Obama with a big transgender decree. What's yalls thoughts?  
Obama would be a moderate in today’s dem party. Which is why using hillary as a benchmark for all “moderate” Dems is stupid 
Obamacare dies in <3 years. Book it
Obamacare is 2 things mainly. 1) the expansion of Medicare 2) An marketplace where co-ops partner with customers to deal with insurance companies. 
Obamacare is such bullshit
Obamas last night in office, what will y'all remember him for most?
Obamas legacy is now trump, for better or for worse
Obama's social agenda (or rather the social agenda that has happened largely organically, supported by Barack Obama) contributed to the angry sentiment throughout the uneducated rural white world
Oberlin College demands include a new personal favorite: "We demand that black student leaders be provided a $8.20/hr stipend for their continuous organizing efforts around the well being of black people on oberlins campus, city, and beyond."
Obese white bitch who is all about "body positivity" and is also a huge SJW. Basically apologizes for being white and cis. It's too good to be true. 
OBJ is not borderline tho becker
OBJ 🐩
OBJs intangibles were that he's a huge prick piece of shit cheap shotting whiny ass bitch. Eli's intangibles are that, while he sucks most of the time, he has the ability to go supersaiyan mode and win TWO championships. 
Obvious troll
Obvious troll tweet is obvious 
Obviously a lot can happen. But OSU and Georgia are probably locks (OSU beats Mich and wins out, Georgia doesn’t lose until at least SEC championship). Then Oregon winning out would probably make it considering their rank now. Question then is Natty undefeated vs Bama
Obviously Aaron Hernandez at 1, OJ Simpson 2, maybe Ray Lewis 3, Jon Jones gotta be top 5
Obviously assuming your salaries get you representative value in a player, and no injuries, etc 
Obviously Bama and clemson. Then 6-0 Ohio state. Then who?
Obviously baseball and football throwing are different but i don’t know any baseball players who come back from a UCL without surgery
Obviously both were for masturbatory purposes
Obviously boy. Name is easa not ersa 
Obviously easier said than done, which would be the understatement of the century
Obviously fumbles suck but there’s a lot of success on the drives so far
Obviously he’s not a team doctor or anything, but there’s clearly a market for his “expertise”
Obviously impossible to do it retroactively. My list was more the Daniel Jones mole bad pick from the beginning, less of a true FLB list
Obviously it’s dependent on a lot of factors like coaching and OL and pass catching weapons. For example the consensus with Goff and Jimmy G is clearly that they are the limiting factors in their offense, whereas it’s the opposite with Darnold
"Obviously MVP candidate but i
Don’t include him for this game"
Obviously not my area of expertise but I’ve read smart takes from smart people on both sides of the issue, and I think I lean toward keeping the original 2 dose plan because that’s what was studied, tested, and proven effective. This is of course contingent on getting shots into arms at an acceptable rate very soon. 
Obviously soccer cleats are out of the question 
Obviously step 1 would be to try convince the CIC that it’s a bad idea, and hope he comes around. But if he doesn’t, and he wants to do crazy shit, there comes a point where congress needs to step in. 
Obviously that one so I didn’t include it
Obviously the SAT sucks. It fucking sucks I know it ruins a Saturday and costs $50. But you only have a 10% chance of doing it, that’s the whole point. Bet on yourselves!
Obviously the US has a lot more influence over Israel than Palestine, but I don’t think it’s a ton vs zero; I think it’s relatively a lot less over Israel and a lot more over Palestine than that
Obviously the US. But also Germany. Czech Republic. Netherlands. 
Obviously we're not going to go from apathetic to world champs in 15 years. We shouldn't try to be the Brooklyn Nets.
Obviously when I'm not wearing pants
Obviously you want them to progress and even can expect it, but it’s not abnormal for them to not progress
Ocarina of Time 🐐
Occupy People’s Park!
October 6. McGregor vs Numagomedov
Odd vs even?
Odds are 1:1 because you made a claim and I said “I’ll take that bet”
Odds bama gets in?
Odds Garrett doesn't go first overall?
Odds GoT has a hidden bud light promo somewhere in the final season?
Odds he says something to the lines of fuck Don?
Odds KD resigns with GS?
Odds Mack finishes outside RB20
Odds Marty Bennett gets a TD today?
Odds ND has a COVID outbreak and the game is postponed?
Odds of WW3 increase (slightly)
Odds on favorite for RB1 ROS
Odds osweiler breaks 150 yards passing?
Odds still less than 175/175
"Odds
BB is out?
Arthur Smith is out?
Bears trade fields and draft Caleb?"
Oddsmakers are good at their jobs
Ode on a Grecian Urn
Odell is a child
Odell was PR and it was a poison call, but Odell ran over to the ball to throw a block for no reason, kicked the ball, and Carolina recovered for a TD
OdLOL Beckham
Of all people Jeff, you Pats fans should know
Of all people, Anthony fucking Weiner hahahahaha
Of all the athletes in America, of fucking course it would be him to say that  
Of all the preachy millionaire SJWs in Hollywood, he's the preachiest. And he madonna to a chair and beat the shit out of her, aka the original Chris Brown
Of all the things to hate LeBron for, this doesn’t seem like a good one 
Of all the times we've roasted Jeff in here, this one burns the most
Of course
Of course all of those things are important and I'd also never take suicide lightly. No doctor should ever be forced to do this against his/her will, and every patient should be 1000% sure of their decision. I'm just very pro individual liberty and I'm generally against the notion of protecting people from themselves.
Of course Analysts opinions are perhaps worthless
Of course any actually collective unionization hasn't happened yet, but this is the first step. And Dana must be fuming. 
Of course everybody compares it to the $200MM paycheck vs pacquiao, but Mayweathers last fight he got $32MM plus whatever cut of 400K PPV. This offer is $25MM, plus probably 2.5MM PPVs. Yeah this is a lowball, but it's not an outlandish place to start. Of course Floyd is impossible to make deals with so it's prob never gonna happen, but if it wasn't Floyd, it might hold water
Of course he’s a “Obama is a war criminal!” guy
Of course I am but seriously that is one of the funniest things I've ever seen 
Of course I don't want to be callous to issues like that. But you NEED to draw a line somewhere, and that line must be clearly defined. If that line includes human trafficking, ok that might be reasonable. But if there's no line or if the line is the slightest bit elastic, the repercussions could be existentially threatening to the US as we know it. 
Of course I jumped off when Kap led us to the Super Bowl, but originally...
Of course I meant like blockchain could be implemented to take over the ticket industry for example since it's impossible to forge or copy a ticket
Of course it's not profitable. Nearly half the NHL teams run deficits
Of course MassHealth is awesome. It predates the ACA #RomneyCare
Of course polling data takes at least a week to come out, so nothing yet one way or the other. 538 says historically post first debate polls are very close to the final result 
Of course the chiefs are the beneficiaries of both
Of course the downside is that doctors would on average make less if there are more of them and competition for acceptances goes down... and also quality of care may decrease on average... but more people are being treated
Of course the safe route is to be same old boring ass, say whatever you need to say hillary. But hey yneverknow
Of course the texans dont want to trade him but if Watson is truly as fed up as its being reported, they might not have a choice. not terribly different from harden and houston i guess.
Of course they are. Every pro player is an exception lol
Of course welker
Of course when the spreads start to hit 7.5+ it changes things
Of course you can go with the tried and true: the joooooooos
Of course you go
Of course, countries going with boldface lies (China, Russia, Iran, etc) are in their own category
Of course. Big miss by me
Of course. But the reality is they are being conflated in public opinion, rightly or wrongly.
Of course. It was incredible
Of course. Pretty sure his name was “fake rapist”
Of course. She was legit a threat to hurt someone, like girls wouldn't fight her
Of fucking course Goodwin still beat me smh
Of the Power 5, Oklahoma has the biggest positive difference. And according to 538, Bob Stoops' reputation for losing big games should actually be a reputation for repeatedly getting to big games
Of those who wear cologne, what % religiously watch football?
Of which the main expenses are nursing homes 
Off the top of my head, Darrelle Revis?
Off topic but any of you play Red Dead Redemption back in HS?
Off topic but has anybody read about this Brazilian presidential election? Seems like we just got another Duerte
Off topic but the Kim K robbery story is hilarious 
Off topic, but I realized I associate you with your avatars, which are often other people in the groupme. And it weirds me the fuck out. 
Offense looks absolutely amazing
Offense pretty much can't be worse, so I suppose he has at least higher upside
Offense was great today and has been bad before. ”True ability" is prob somewhere in between. Teams being night and day with their execution happens to almost every team every year. 
offensive genius McVay looking like best deal maker of all time Trump right now
Offensively is it mcdaniels every play?
Office Thursdays we’re appointment TV
Officer training school (candidate school in other branches). Every branch has their own. The 2 ways to become an officer in The military are you go to OTS/OCS, or you go to a military academy 
Officially no but I suppose it’s not unusual for a casual but scored round
Oh @Jamie Bourque add Emyr to the Jeff nut sucking list
Oh @JustFacts✅ forgot to mention this but I hope the Dems sweep because then my shot of winning our Don bet increases drastically 
Oh add Saints to the likely need-QB teams
Oh Alex Sarabia 
Oh also back to the PGA tour thing, they also would have made the course in unbelievably tough conditions I've certainly I've never played in.
Oh also Connor made $12k
Oh also gotta love Grifball
Oh also i forgot to share this, seen in Cork
Oh also I shaved my head because I thought it might help with the heat. It didn’t. 
Oh also I, like John, could do the chair Challenge without shoes, but not with shoes
Oh also@Skimmer  who is the celebrity you hate the most?
Oh and also I motion we should have 3 IR spots because of corona. Again, please voice approval/objection 
Oh and also this job comes with a very high risk that you will injure the very assets that will determine your future pay
Oh and also you don't have a choice, you have to go through this 3 year program without pay, even if you're good enough to skip it
Oh and Amari Cooper if he stays the course
Oh and American Enterprise Institute is great, but very right wing. There's also a blog Marginal Revolution that's a bit abstract but not bad
Oh and Brazil lol 
Oh and Carson for HUD is retarded too
Oh and definitely take a picture with Fearless Girl and make it your fb prof pic
Oh and emyr 
Oh and finding dory
Oh and finding real friends could be extra tough
Oh and for positive tests, GA listed date as first symptom date, not positive test date
Oh and he doesn’t drink lol
Oh and he posted a picture of him with a girl with her face blurred out to prove that the accuser is real, but it’s literally just a photo from years ago with a blurred face and filter 
Oh and he would put the TV on as background noise when he was cooking or in the shower(?) and he would fucking BLAST the volume
Oh and I saw zootopia on a plane, not bad actually
Oh and leasing the stadium 
Oh and of course he doesn't apply the ban to Saudi because he has businesses there...
Oh and one time his family came over because they were going to a play or something, and I was watching something on TV, went to the bathroom, and when I came back his mom had put on some hallmark channel movie and I was like well fuck me i guess 
Oh and sometimes my mom pays my flights home for Christmas or something. But she always says don't tell your dad hahaha
Oh and that Animals song senior year because trevor used to play it nonstop
Oh and that will smith movie, forgot the title
Oh and the earthquake one where the defense would all get knocked over
Oh and they love their live music. Like almost every bar has it Thurs-Sun
Oh and upsetting Syracuse in b-ball
Oh and whenever anybody was shot we had to treat it like a legit gunshot wound. So like applying tourniquets and stuff. Those things are fucking painful
Oh and Woodbury
Oh band on the field is all time for sure. Malice at the palace is a different category lol
Oh beating Tyrod Taylor was fun too
Oh Becker blew a golden opportunity there
Oh boom on cue lol 
Oh btw @AbadBot describe to us the process of how you pee
Oh btw Becker Connor hit his first hole in 1 yesterday 
Oh btw Becker I got chastised by the UMD starter yesterday for not wearing a collared shirt
Oh btw Becker, Goodwin had a perfect response to the Browns kiss question so I'll just go with that 
Oh btw great add goody
Oh btw idk why but that reminds me I had a joke go terribly at work on Friday 
"Oh btw James is about to
Have a baby girl"
Oh btw that play the Rams run for the 2 pointer is very similar to the play I proposed in here like 6 months ago 
Oh btw the Hungary in the Middle East Classico moment reminded me of this gem from a few months ago
Oh come on I thought that was pretty funny
Oh congrats dude very impressive. I don't hate it, but I mean it's work. Pros are the pay, other analysts are really cool, projects are short so you have like a new job all the time, work is generally challenging. Cons are the hours are long, you don't have as much contact with other said analysts as I'd hope, may have to travel, and direction is frequently unclear
Oh damn forgot about those. Chestnuts also good nice picks guys
Oh damn that is midtown midtown 
Oh Danny Boy
Oh Daytona is worth it
Oh did you not know that about Ireland without me telling you?
Oh difference is I said an OT is the ladder instead of the RB
Oh flashback to yesterday's Stephen Wu conversation, who remembers the hilariously cringeworthy Good Vibrations video he made Senior Year
Oh forgot there are 2 different tournaments lolololol 
Oh fuck I got it
Oh fuck I just got murdered

Oh geez I have no clue haha. It's complicated. And it's an algorithm with several inputs that are also algorithms that I don't know
Oh geez idk if I can handle that much dominance in one weekend
Oh geez it was about 50 Diglett, 45 OTF, 5 "the Emyr"
Oh geez please post it all
Oh geez that’s good
Oh geez this is actually heartbreaking
Oh geez this is really tough
Oh geez...

Oh good one lemme think
Oh good point
Oh good question 
Oh good, an actual player is here to tel me in right or wrong
Oh good, I gave up after half a season

Oh goody might call me that haha
Oh great kids name is a fucking Da Vinci Code riddle

Oh I thought it was when you bang and then switch overnight and she wakes up like wtf
Oh I thought we did
Oh I thought you were trolling. Lavine fucking blows
Oh I wanted “mint berry crunch” but that was never gonna happen hahahaha
Oh in that case idgaf. Would only care about attending
Oh is vinatieri still playing?

Oh my lanta jayson Tatum 
Oh my Lanta tommy boy 
Oh my lanta...
Oh my word...
Oh my word...
Oh no
Oh no @Skimmer that’s how you lose more money
Oh no he's a piece of shit, just not a piece of shit who talks like that. And also Becker doesn't talk like that
Oh no I meant honesty as “we actively discussed inviting you and decided against it”
Oh no I meant my position for you to accept the other side
Oh no not this again
Oh no Scott Hanson pls be safe
Oh no someone please pour one out for the Boston fans
Oh no the GS analysts! Even Kristen doesn’t know horror like them
Oh no the seat in front of me is 4 inches closer and I was totally using that space!
Oh no usually the joke is terrible even when someone gets it, but it is even more terrible when nobody gets it, which is most of the time 
Oh no vinateri retire pls
Oh nooo I have the same bet as Marcus
Oh noooo Drew Brees 
Oh noooo Nick you lose. First hitler comparison loses. That’s the rules. 
Oh nooooo Kyrie also doesn't believe in dinosaurs
OH NOOOOOOO Draymond is a flat earth skeptic too noooooooo 
Oh okay booooooooo
Oh please say “is it possible more people care about opening the government than immediate DACA?”
Oh question for y’all runners. Do you burn more fat running on an empty stomach?
Oh reminds me, wanted to poll the group: if you wanted to talk to a friend (who you talk to regularly), would you phone call or FaceTime?
Oh right I remember you mentioning that a while ago back
Oh right yeah lmao that was mega cap
Oh Scott Hanson I have missed you and your sharp jawline
Oh shit St Louis is right now. So I guess 11 lol my B
Oh shit that's right haha
Oh shit wrong groupme
Oh shit. Happy birthday marcus
Oh Sirius for sure
Oh so 2 players is fine but 3+ players is a cyborg. Both please
Oh so now she thinks she can date a married NFL player. Smh browns. 
Oh sweet baby Jesus
Oh sweet baby Jesus I can't wait to watch you two box
Oh that really hot pole vaulter 
Oh that reminds me of an Air Force Kelltics moment a few weeks ago. We were playing ultimate football (ultimate frisbee but with a football). This unathletic Butthole dude in my flight who everyone hates makes a pretty impressive pass breakup and yells “MARSHAWN LYNCH!” And I’m like “uh do you you know what position Marshawn plays”. He has no clue. I say “can you name a single defensive back in the entire NFL?” Absolute silence. 
Oh that reminds me, Leg 3 of the Kelleher plan: You can be under anybody's insurance who is willing to have you, for as long as you want, as long as it makes financial sense. Basically an insurance guarantor. 
Oh that’s right it was me who brought it up
Oh the 2008 gymnastics team. Shawn Johnson, Nastia Liukin, Gabby Douglas, Mckayla Maroney...
Oh the irony...
Oh then it must be unicorn and leprechaun awareness month too!
Oh they’re also super racist
Oh they're counties in NH haha
Oh this teacher was a 6 at best too, but she would straight up whale tail and bend over and everything, and did it all the time. I didn't have her, but there were pictures and they spread like wildfire. Even the parents knew about her. When I was there they tried to fire her but she had an emotional breakdown and they ended up not firing her, but she took like a leave of absence or something. Not sure if she's still there now. 
Oh USC of course
Oh wait he doesn't root for any teams
Oh wait Jeff coming in to repeat something goody says 
Oh wait no I’ve seen him
Oh wait ok I lied I watched like 3 episodes of the bachelor with Kayla Quinn 
Oh wait wasn’t there a story where a player said he was recruited by Alabama and was given a 3 star and he literally wasn’t even a player
Oh wait you were serious?
Oh wait... 
Oh well I'm out of characters
Oh well there's that too. But I meant the whole thing with the Labor Party being full of antisemites
Oh well your apartment then
Oh well, shit happens
Oh what a coincidence
Oh what's the big Philippines island called
Oh whoever has mine, if you didn’t already order, send to my parents address 
Oh ye of little faith 
Oh ye of little faith! A Legion of demon spirits are no match for your strong Irish Catholicism 
Oh yeah
Oh yeah haha well that depends on goody rule #4. If they were really smart, they'd continue to be cute dogs and just live the best lives ever
Oh yeah he’d probably be discharged for the Grab her by the pussy thing alone
Oh yeah I remember hearing about that. Didn't know who was involved besides Alec and Skaf, but if it's a brawl then everybody/nobody is guilty
Oh yeah I was just listing weekends we shouldn't do
Oh yeah it's way too soon. Still part of the hype pitch though
Oh yeah that’s correct
Oh yeah then we can have monstrous 70 point weeks. Why don't we play fantasy soccer guys?
Oh yeah we’re gonna paint the Gordo negro
Oh yeah wtf is that 
Oh yeah. Straight to the gulag. 
Oh you mean only one body and one skill...
Oh, and guns
Oh, the BC Rugby claims too
Oh, yeah I think so. Like Pokemon have base stats + IVs. Pretty sure this is for the IVs
Oh. GRRM
Oh. It’s not a live sitcom but how could I forget bobs burgers. Wipes the floor with all the above 
OH. MY. GAWD. 
Oh. The Danielle Brazel saga
Oh. Well we were around. 
Oh. Yes straight into the veins. 
ohh if its until the first line that i know someone than i get through 7
Ohhh
Ohhh good guess
Ohhh he used to go STUPID in madden
OHHH NO NOT FINRAND!!
Ohhh that bitch lol
ohhhhh i just saw your snap chan... guess it is bad
Ohhhhh lmao no no no no it's just that many of her prof pics are with Trevor (admittedly a handsome gentleman), and I joked she probably told her friends he was her boyfriend or something 
Ohhhhhh 
OHHHHHH MY GOD HAHAHAHAHA
Ohhhhhh shit drachman
Ohhhhhhh shiiiiiiiit
OHHHHHHH yeah I remember that not a skim just a failure to recall
Ohhhhhhh... my bad
Ohio State gotta be up there, unfortunately
Ohio State looks incredible
Ohtani glaze on TNF get the fuck outta here
Ohtani UCL strain :(
Oi 
Oikos Triple Zero, as promoted by Cam Newton. 110 calories, no fat
OiLOLers
OJ is electric 
OJ Mayo banned from the NBA?! 👀
Ok
Ok $530 of which is unrealized debt 
Ok 4/22-23 weekend, @🐟🦴🩻 are you able?
Ok actually did the genesis half time show not happen or did i literally blank it from my memory
Ok and Sunday night we can host the Beatdown in Beantown
Ok any recommendations for a fight watching spot?
Ok bottom 2 after week 13? Week 14?
Ok bottom 3 is too harsh but definitely bottom third (tri-tile?)
Ok brace yourself, but it’s important that you know: there’s a pandemic going on for the past year and a half
"Ok business idea: A finance industry consulting firm of only entry level and low experienced consultants. They are good at technology, experienced with finance through school, and damn good at excel.

Business case: Big ass consulting firms like Accenture don't operate as a cohesive unit. You get a mishmash of consultants, some good some bad. Companies can hire these junior consultants basically as assistants meant for BA or PMO work, for half the price of a Deloitte or EY consultant. "
Ok business idea: crossfit, but for makeup. Get a group of girls together on a "make up team", give them a bunch of pretty normal stuff, and let them experiment
Ok but say you have a stack of paper with 3 holes punched. Do you have 3 holes total or 3 holes per page?
Ok but then that would put you in a situation where you literally could not lose and only win
Ok deal
Ok deandre might be as good as his stats show...
Ok done you should be getting a call sometime next week
Ok either the Olympics copied the Harry Potter winter music or vice versa 
Ok FH gathering at goodys apartment for the super bowl since it will be vacant 
Ok fine stay in your gluten free safe space comfort zone 
Ok first where did I say that and second just let me have this temporarily and third go get a team you teamless squid
Ok for real here. Trump wins, is he impeached immediately?
Ok fuck baseball
Ok fuckholes, top 5 power rankings of athletes in legal trouble. GO!
Ok good 
Ok good I have at least one person to commiserate with
Ok good lol
Ok goody fucking no. NFL teams gets >75% of its revenue through national TV deals, whereas baseball and basketball are tiny in comparison. The only thing franchise worth amounts to is how much he could sell the team for, and he obviously isn't gonna do that. He dumped on his fan base as leverage to move, and he's a big piece of shit for it. 
Ok gotta grind then... #grindhard #wotm when it all pays off
Ok here’s one: if we each were a dessert, what would we be?
Ok Houston football did play a prime time game against a very high ranking opponent and there was an upset. Was I mostly wrong? Yes. Am I completely retarded? Also yes. But at least this explains my memory
Ok how about first week of Feb? Is a weekend trip viable?
Ok how about if you have a 10 of each ethnicity. Now what?
Ok how about third week of Feb
Ok how bout minimum 8 games for injury. And if either is benched for the season, they lose, unless both are benched and it continues. 
Ok how did all of you turn into morons overnight
Ok how do I get my face to look like a pile of mashed potatoes?
Ok I admit my analogy was flawed. But the entire state of Wisconsin calls Green Bay their home team. Buffalo has Rochester and Syracuse
Ok I can dig it, actually sounds like a pretty good and realistic idea. What happens if you repeatedly fail?
Ok I cheated and looked it up. I'm only pissed at one that I missed lol
Ok i concede 
Ok I disagree with that call and I haven’t seen the replay yet
Ok I hit level 5. Now what? Do I get to battle?
Ok I like you again goodwin
Ok I love that they’re really trying to win the all star game. But holy shit I can not believe how many fouls they’re trying to draw
Ok I prefer the old SNF song to the new one, but I do like the Ohhhhhhh Sunday Night bit
Ok I see. Geez I have no idea how you'd do that. Demographics would be huge, maybe more important than the event promotion itself. Gotta be some combo of quality/quantity of promotion and some demographic quantified 
Ok I sent all y’all a text. I will make a google doc, and you will add your 10 songs under your recipients name. 
Ok I think everybody can do Saturday at 8pm
ok i thought becker was being harsh but now i agree
Ok I was super confused for a second
Ok I was wondering about it, like how much do you make, how hard is it to start, any unexpected hassles, etc
Ok I’ll take off Saturday 
Ok I’m all for the nice moment but come on
Ok I’m all in #WeWantBama
Ok I’m already out on copilot
Ok I’m an episode and a half in and man this is weirdddd and god awfully entertaining 
Ok I’m not a big rap guy but this Drake vs Pusha T beef is hysterical right now
Ok I’m putting money in the Russell 2000. If I lose money, it’s your faults
Ok idk why that is happening. But JK Rowling getting cancelled (again) for this tweet and it’s hilariousad 
Ok if I backed off within 30 seconds then that would make sense. The claim (for years) has been little league
Ok I'll concede there. We have some players with amazing talent. Should we expect that trend to continue? Do we fire and hire until we can find a coach that can turn that into 9 wins a year?
Ok I'll expect it Sunday ;)
Ok I'll make the pool 
Ok I'm clearly missing something here...
Ok I'm dismissing that as Reddit bullshit already but I'll read it anyway
Ok it’s possible i do look like nick Mullen’s
Ok it’s risen significantly since then. This volatility is still bananas tho 
ok it’s under 40. Naysayers, your rebuttals?
Ok Jeff you were right fuck these refs
Ok Jimmy G I see you
Ok just call when you get here
Ok just checking
Ok just Facebook the product then, not the Facebook collection of social media. Chan you’re into this stuff what’s your talk
Ok just ice and Advil thanks here’s $200
Ok just trying to get a gauge on the pulse. But big yikes for our punta friends
Ok let me know if you want me to continue to tanksplain 
Ok like that, but lower standards and prices
Ok looked it up. Zone D was illegal, then in 1966 they changed it to essentially defensive 3 seconds rule. Then in 1981, they modified it to "illegal defensive alignments" such as can't double an off ball opponent on the opposite side of the court. Then in 2001, they scrapped the whole thing. 
Ok looks like they're still gonna play, that was a short boycott
Ok maybe I'll give it a try. I usually played multiplayer with the others. Loved Gun Game
Ok maybe I'm missing something here... Outlow and Hilliman, same year, both played about the same, both got scholarships (I think). What's the issue?
Ok maybe not Jeff 
Ok my example yesterday was Palestinian but I was pretty damn close
Ok new job: treatment router, where you have interdisciplinary studies and able to easily diagnose something enough to either solve it or route it to the right specialist. 
Ok next Fuckhole open, becker gives joe 1 strokes on the 10 hardest handicap holes. What are you wagering? I’d say at least $100 
Ok next year tho watch out
Ok nick, time to whip out the big dick 
Ok no new favorite
Ok not a physicist but airplanes and stuff I’m semi knowledgeable. And the answer is (no shit) the smart bois are not in consensus on why air flows faster over a curve than in a straight path, and faster movement of particles = lower pressure. They know what, can do all the math, but don’t know 100% why. I’m going with this until Drachman tells me I’m full of shit
Ok not terrible
Ok now I know you're not serious thank god
Ok now I take it back and go fuck your self 
Ok now I’m anti rollback again
Ok now I’m thinking Tom might be lying about that 8.1
Ok now I'm getting it I think. So the hospital jacks up rates a ton, so that the 35% is enough
Ok now that I know you’re free, I’d like you to help me move in Friday morning
Ok now we can celebrate. Suck it dodgers 
Ok now who mans this is
Ok Obi Toppin is the undisputed #1 name in the draft 
Ok onside kick 
Ok Passer Rating boomer
Ok phew it was a reference
Ok plan one in September then
Ok poll for everybody here
Ok R word is old already 
Ok reading a bit more about it now; I guess the heart of the allegation is the Collective Bargaining Agreement being expired. Plaintiff is saying it expired in 2013 and US Soccer refused to change it; defendant is saying USWNT signed a memorandum in 2013 agreeing to extend it until 2016. 
Ok real question. Is that Asian kid a boy or girl?
Ok re-ceasefire
Ok say he throws 95. Still amazing
Ok see you at patrons in 20 mins 
Ok semi serious, possibly relationship destroying response, but you could say you didn’t invite her because marika is a total wet blanket
Ok slow down. Let's say a procedure requires only the doctors time, the anesthetic, and crutches. You're telling me the insurance will only pay the hospital for one of those things? And the hospital eats the rest?
Ok so 3 against with logical reasons, 1 against for a bad reason, 1 can't tell. But I at least understand that PPR is not gonna happen so I guess that's good that it's settled. 
Ok so 3/4 of y’all have heard of it. @Motorcycle Man turns out that you are wrong, not legal, and not cool
Ok so call wins though
Ok so here's the answer, from Wikipedia. During WWII, Oakland was a major player in the shipbuilding and cannery industries. Post WWII and during the great migration, thousands of poor laborers from the south, both white and black, came to Oakland for work in those industries. Racial tension was quick to form. When those industries declined, it got worse. 
"Ok so I’m doing “who would I pick for an unknown sports competition” so more focused on ball sports than raw speed/strength.

Jamie
Joe
Marcus
Darrow
Chan
Goody
John
Kevin
Becker
Emyr
Nick
Jeff"
Ok so let's say I buy a player from Joe for $20. Does he now have $220 for the draft? 
Ok so now Rapaport is saying it’s $503 with $477 guaranteed
Ok so now they can throw the bank at Cousins and/or sign other guys
Ok so only restrictions are on players who are out for this season. Just making sure. 
Ok so seems like next weekend would be ideal if becker can swing it
Ok so the party establishment would concede an establishment loss and pick their preferred outsider? I suppose that's possible, but I think that only happens if Rubio gets <10% in the first 5-10 states and Trump is dominating. If Cruz and Trump are close, I'm not sure they go balls out on Cruz like that though
Ok so this is the situation where they DUI’d and hit someone
Ok so you find out Friday where your residency will be?
Ok speak now or forever hold your peace
Ok start obvious: gotta be something about saving yourself, and the person in front
Ok strong disagree there
Ok sure lets hear it
Ok sure then under that definition, I still stand by my position: if you can save any innocent lives from terrorism, use any means necessary to do so. 
Ok sure. What do I just need your emails?
Ok target being US consulate looks shaky at best. The rest looks legit
Ok thanks but they look ridiculous so I will not be using them to represent my fandom
Ok thanks maybe I’ll go get shoes
Ok that genesis finish was SICK
"Ok that gif inspired me to look up something I’ve always wondered: why is Pepe short for Jose? The alleged answer:

In Latin, Saint Joseph’s name is always followed by the letters “P.P” for pater putativus (commonly accepted) father of Jesus Christ. In Spanish, the letter “P” is pronounced “peh” giving rise to the nickname Pepe for Jose."
Ok that is an incorrect take if it’s for the same reasons 
Ok that one was kinda funny
Ok that person is an r-word and nobody in this league has any misconceptions that adams isn’t top 3 (maybe Kevin) so it’s not worth trying to lowball
Ok that was classic Tom 
Ok that was pretty sweet
Ok that was sick
Ok that’s especially hilarious because that’s actually not /s. They have a full medical staff. So you don’t have to leave work to go to the doctor
Ok the ducks one is still cool
Ok the first part was good but wow that got dark real quick 
Ok then double it
Ok then scratch that second part then
Ok there is the balls
Ok there's an idea. Open a med school.
Ok this is a good article on it. Tldr: players are better in year 4 > 3 > 2 > 1, as expected. But, Tate for a year is almost certainly better than the difference between year 1 and year 2. So basically is Tate + rookie better or worse than Replacement + year 2? I’d guess yes. 
Ok this is my favorite
Ok time for BC offense to redeem itself
Ok top 15
Ok way out of my league here but isnt this good news?
Ok weird drake album 
Ok well there's our fundamental difference then. I have zero sympathy for terrorists. You do have some sympathy for them, because they're humans. That's fair. 
Ok what are the answers Sway
ok what are you gonna do with the other $880 million?
Ok what is the general idea
Ok whatever happened with Udoka is clearly crazy. Matt Barnes of all people out here being like “yo this is fucked”
Ok which of you buttholes asked for a new becker schtick for Christmas 
Ok Which of your accounts is this?
Ok who bet Jalen Carter unders parlay
ok will iam and fergie
Ok wow this is up there 
Ok wow this isn’t even close
Ok y’all I’m making the assignments now 
ok yeah i think chan is right with Wiz.  he dominated freshman year
Ok yeah I would agree. I just played so many of those songs on repeat with @Skimmer in Keyes that it has sentimental value 
Ok yeah it’s becker and it’s not close. Jamie is a huge gap to second
Ok yeah not official until Reg season, or if a team signs another QB
Ok you could also like this message so you can split 4/3 and candy ass darrow can be acquiesced
Ok you guys can sit out then due to Joe's... condition. OTHER FOUR ARE ON!!
"Ok, 12.0 even. You over, me under, 12 push. $20

Agreed?"
Ok. Any caveats for benching/injures?
Ok. Potential advantage to the middle of the pack (non championship and Posa contenders) there, but I'm ok with it for now
Ok. That's it tho?
Okay
Okay Chan's is pretty accurate too, minus the weird skin tone
Okay come through. Bring catan if you want
Okay cool
Okay goodwin that was really fucking good
Okay I will also be in Chicago that following week lol
Okay if we can't go to Stowe what is the alternative?
Okay let’s role play this out
Okay okay cool if you like Indian food, you can come to JC and have lunch there, which will take you to WTC and also give you the most picturesque view of NYC
Okay so if Lebron got injured his first year in Miami that would be fine then
Okay so if we get around that hurdle, then trade goes through??
Okay so Saturday night is bar night for sure then. I had a good time at A4cade but we’d all have to show early. I always liked Black Rose. Otherwise taking any other bar recommendations
Okay so what is people's plans here, depart from Boston Friday, return Sunday?
Okay that was the lamest line I've ever heard lmao
Okay that’s not true no need to comfort me with BS 
Okay well let us know. Sooner than later
Okay wtf John 
Okay, just send me any sort of makeshift bracket by Jan 7 at 4:30 and I'll keep track
Okay?
OKC really pissed this game away
Okie doke I am likely to be there around End of June if you’re around. Maybe even for 4th of July
Okinawa?
Oklahoma 
Oklahoma fans are Dewey after No Vacancy won battle of the bands
Oklahoma State
Oklahomar?
OkLOLhoma City
OL loses
OL might be rough but you can’t tell me AB, Brandon Marshall, Josh Gordon, Aaron Hernandez, and OJ Simpson aren’t terrorizing any defense. And they catch passes from Michael Vick
Oladipo dark horse
Olave is the buzz guy. Shockingly I read Pickens has been floated too
Olbermann is the definition of unhinged
Old BC rearing its ugly head
Old news but ESPN is just tanking its brand. Between the awful personnel moves, the fights with YouTube TV, the black outs, the app sucking, now the bet platform failing. Does anybody under 60 have a positive opinion of them?
Old white people love 2 things: gold and the US military 
Ole Miss, future bastion of elite higher education

On AF birthday smh
On Basketball wall pads just thrown on the floor hahaha
On Bastille Day
ON CUE
On cue 
On cue lol 
On cue, as momentum shifts 
On field product can’t be worse but tbh I’d probably rather be 0-6 without Rodgers than 2-4 with him.
On first glance it makes our draft of an OT at 9 more questionable. Especially when we could’ve got like minkah Fitzpatrick to fill an obvious defensive hole. But all depends on how good McGlinchey is and what they do with the pick. 
On my bucket list is: Bring home a one night stand, bang in the morning, then roll over, light up a cigarette in bed, and say "so the weathers nice today"
On my to do list
On New Years I partook in a onetime usage of a marijuana cigarette in California, where it was and continues to be legal, and it's not a fireable offense at Accenture...
On one hand I agree, on the other hand, can literally anybody blame him?
"On one hand I could not agree more.

On the other hand, yesterday I had never heard of Canva, and now I have 🤔 "
On one hand, I agree with you. On the other, it’s better than every other division
On paper value *
On Reddit Air Force, the different mission support jobs (personnel, finance, etc) get shit on cyclically. This week it’s been medical, and omg the stethoscope boiz on there are throwing digital hands, and it absolutely mirrors the reaction to joes post in here
On redzone
On second thought it was on 10 as we were talking about dominating the back nine
On second thought this makes no sense for CFB. A team relegated would have recruits all jump ship. It would suck for the school and the recruits. 
On sight
On Sunday? Yeah I'd be down
On that Damien Williams breakaway TD, Tyreek just catches up to him from 10 yards back like it’s nothing. Guy is unbelievably fast
On that note I’m super duper ready for the fuckhole open
On that note it’s kinda hysterical that the warriors, the best and most hated team of the decade, are getting their reset season during the pandemic, and it possible the Patriots will get the same
On that, the past 3-4 days have seen a notable series of offensives by the UAF against the Russians in the Kherson (south) and Donbass (east) regions
On the balance sheet we should list every transaction separately, no aggregation
On the bright side BCs offensive radar kinda looks like a shamrock
On the bright side I already hated machado, so the transition should be seamless
On the bright side I am lifting more than ever so that’s good I guess
On the bright side Javon Baker and Xavier worthy are up there too
On the bright side this came in today:
On the bright side, a story involving NASCAR, a guy named bubba, and a noose could’ve turned out a lot worse
On the bright side, we never have to have our hopes of a Natty run dashed week 1 like Nebraska or ND fans 
On the contrary, you did actively push back on my attempt to ease your "burden"
On the feet we surround him and somebody could get a body lock, then a second body lock, then a trip. Once he’s down 2 people to wrap the legs, somebody to repeatedly half Nelson or armbar
On the floor. Yeah, lying down. We know. 
On the good side, it’s a movement that truly represents the common people over the “elite”. On the bad (and recently more common) side, it caters to the basest impulses of people’s immediate demands and resentments
On the other hand, if you're predicting how tall someone will be and your independent variables are moms height and dads height, and your R2 is .7, that's probably a pretty bad R2.
On the other side of the bank is Management Consulting, where I assume @Jamie Bourque will be. That deals more with process improvement, stop gap analysis, control frameworks, change management, etc.
On the season?
On the topic of baseball, I would like to quickly shit on Becker for saying Ohtani would never amount to anything
On the topic, this thread from trevor Bauer on the HOF is good

Once again an incredible Team Kelleher pun gets little love from you knuckledragging poors 
Once again Darrow just far out shining the rest
Once again I believe you’re in 4 down territory

Once again the Foxtrot Hotel is a decade ahead of the curve 
Once again, #TeamKelleher🇺🇸 remains the last bastion of strength and hope in a world of chaos and conformity 
Once again, already an incredible week of football 
Once again, the Thompsons’ love of random players of the yesteryear 
Once ESPN fired Curt Schilling you knew they were going downhill 
Once was really funny because it was my brothers high school graduation party at our house and a ton of people were over. I was sitting at a table with like 6 people and just got up without saying a word. Showered and came down in new clothes. My brother immediately said “dude did you just shit your pants?”

One of my barometers of how much I respect ones NFL opinion is if they think Shanny, consensus top tier coach, was an idiot to want to move on from Jimmy G (40-17)
One of my best friends is a male nurse and loves it haha
One of my coworkers is an Australian exchange officer and he went to NYY @ BAL yesterday. It was a come from behind walk off win after being down 5-3 with 2 outs, then 2 NYY errors. He came in today like “baseball is the greatest sport in the world”
One of my early childhood money memories was finding $20 on the ground, and being super excited to spend it on Jak 2, only to get to the store and realize that video games cost $50. I never paid attention to their price before
One of my favorite badass Bourque moments is when we’re playing flag and this lunatic says he’s in bounds when he’s clearly out. Joe says “are you blind?” Guy goes bananas and says “I will fahkin END you”

One of my favorite niche sports fan clips is the lakers fan in 2018? Being interviewed and confidently said “First things first, FIRE EVERYONE. Second thing, get all the best players!”

One of my friends from bellarmines parents sent him a care package of chocolates and his drill instructors opened it and ate it in front of him 
One of my friends loved that game and its description sounded really appealing but I just never liked it
One of my friends works for SAP and says one of their major clients is a major porn site/producer or something. Apparently they do serious market research just like every other cumpany
One of my Gordo friends (civilian) wanted to get out of jury duty so during the interview he said “I mean if it’s gotten this far, he’s probably guilty”. He successfully got out of the jury duty. 
One of my old Accenture coworkers was a prolific LinkedIn poster and I’m pretty sure he was a psychopath
One of my uncles thinks I work in supply and logistics or something
One of our food runners is this ~20 year old kid from Nigeria. There was a mess up and we had an extra caprese salad for the first time, so the staff gets to eat it. He’s like nibbling at the mozz and tomato, and I’m like dude you eat it together, what you never seen a caprese salad before? He’s like no man. So he takes a bite and he’s like “Yo this is fucking bomb!”
One of our managers is Brazilian and says his favorite thing about the US is college sports

One of the big NorCal / SoCal differences was of you say “the” before a highway. Like 280 vs “the 280”
One of the biggest swings was amongst the Ohio working class. They bought into the Obama "change" nonsense, now they're doing the same with Trump
One of the CBS guys just made a good point. 4th and 1 game on the line, and you are in shotgun and don't even have Gore on the field. There's no surer sign that you do not trust your O Line, and the line knows it.  
One of the funny early BC memories was coming to school, talking about the smerking, getting a ton of “oh yeah man all the time”, then slowly realizing we were the only ones who actually knew what we were doing lmao 
One of the Gasols?
One of the greatest non-baseball baseball moments ever
one of the more absurd parts was that gaetz allegedly didnt know the girl was 17, and when he found out, he was so shocked and disturbed that he didnt contact her again... until the day she turned 18
One of the most embarrassing losses of the year
One of the most intriguing things I heard on this topic was in an episode of Serial, where Adnan’s mom said that her whole life, she’d never experienced racism in the US as a Pakistani immigrant. But that changed in the court hearings, where the prosecution painted Adnan as a crazy sexist and jealous Muslim, and it worked. 
One of the most mine boggling things is that the same “progressives” who say “refusing to use peoples pronouns is violence” also see literal murder of children and say “well there’s two sides to this”

One time a family wanted to sit together so I got a free meal and direcTV. Think it was United
One time connor got so fucked up at roggies he ripped a shot and spiked the glass on the ground, only to be violently thrown outside on the hard sharp ice by the bouncers lmaooo
One time I had a madeleine dipped in tea and all my childhood memories came rushing back
One time I half jokingly told my dads siblings that they got to play during the steroid era. They didn’t like that. 
One time I was having an argument with James Gallo about how to pronounce Nutella. I said it’s NUTella because it’s made of hazelnuts. He said NOOtella but he didn’t know why. Then I went to Italy and they said NOOtela because it’s an Italian word, and I had to take the L
One time I was in a cab coming back from some bar with Chloe and her and somebody else and she was freaking out that they were asking her to pitch in for the cab since she allegedly paid for the cab on the way there. Then we get to BC and she storms out of the car and immediately trips and falls into a puddle of mud. She shrieks in anger and storms off back to her Mod. It was glorious
One time I was walking back from class to Walsh and had that “omg I need to shit right now” feeling, but told myself I could make it back to my room. Took the stairs real quick, then half sprinted through the mods. Got to Walsh and decided I couldn’t make it, and that was the one and only time I used the Walsh lobby bathroom. Closest call of my life. 
one time i went to the gym and i was the only one there, so i locked the door on my way out. my female roommate screamed because she was out for a run and didnt bring her key, and how dare i lock the door without asking her
One time in micro theory, this kid was asking questions about algebra, and Sonmez told him if he needs help with algebra he shouldn't be in honors 😂
One time Jenn Howard (of 2 days prior’s conversation) gifted Emyr Lesean McCoy in fantasy to try to get that D
One time my boss told me to make all my data tables gray outlined instead the default black and I said are you fucking kidding me?
One time my cousin and I touched wieners!!
One time our best wrestler put this kid in a guillotine (BJJ crucifix) in a big dual meet match and the kid just refused to turn. His shoulder looked like it was about to pop out and the kids dad fucking ran out of the stands onto the mat screaming. Never touched anybody but holy shit that was wild.

Only one thing to say to that
Only one with 2/4 final four and the champion
Only one with a walkoff home run into a field of corn while wearing the 1919 throwbacks, just minutes after blowing a 7-4 top of the 9th lead
Only pats fans would make this about them 
Only person I don't want to get last is Chan. If we have back to back years of punishment skippers that would really suck
Only person I ever sold to was "Hey man can I get a dime bag" @Nick D 
Only player who would clash with Giannis is Enes Kanter
Only positive thing they’ve had all season
Only reason I can think of is that he's an egomaniac. Or secretly a trump supporter

Only Tahoe. Northstar, Squaw, Alpine, etc. I'm pretty confident in my abilities to follow you anywhere, unless it's some waist deep shit
Only technically
Only the dubs could make 11 feel small
Only the patriots could simultaneously "underperform" and still cover the spread 
Only the phantom menace was shit
Only thing guaranteed is I know what I’m gonna yell when I win it
Only thing I could find is this tweet from April 2013
Only thing I know is how aircraft, radars and missiles work, and even then I have no idea how I’d operate or fix one of them
Only thing missing is the hot Russian girlfriend who is way out of your league...
Only time I think something is unforgivable is when it’s a pick is a huge reach and totally panned at the moment of draft, then fails. Basically the Daniel jones situation 
Only time I went to an outback was last year on 4th of July, I’d finished a round of golf with a guy from Gloucester and he suggested we follow our round with Outback. I laughed at what I thought was a joke, only to learn outback was his favorite restaurant 
Only way Lebron stays is if Gilbert gives him a cut of ownership, and Lebron becomes NBAs first ever player-coach-GM-owner
Only way would be she’s throwing a bone to the Rs for the first part, ie “I’m not against kavanaugh because of his conservative views”

Other contenders are Aaron Gordon, Draymond, cheating ass Tristan Thompson, BC's Reggie Jackson, Evan Turner, Jeff Teague, Tyler Johnson, and Allen Crabbe
Other countries don't have the same welfare state as the US. The average person in Canada and Scandinavia is much better off and doesn't need the welfare that the US offers. Therefore they're not reliant on taxing the rich as much, and therefore they can distribute taxes to the middle class instead of the poor
Other criticisms notwithstanding, pretty wild to criticize Wilson for joining WWI
Other gents we gotta take Becker up on that
Other highlights include his campaign for Mr. Newton, his dancing, his hilarious workouts and boasts, his run in with Doug Flutie at the plex, and his 1v1 with Danny Luna in basketball
Other than a trump win would raise interest rates
Other than at pool tables on spring break
Other than Edit Gness Productions, of course
Other than make America great again, of course
Other than tangential FH Kyle “Bullseye” Becker of course
Other than the 2QB system, what concepts do the FH (aka above average NFL coaches) think there should be more of in football?

Out here selling gifts?? Man fuck y’all 
out here wondering if Deshaun Watson getting 18 massage therapists to go on record saying they had amicable sessions together is a good legal strategy
Out of control? Well on one hand, the most powerful man in the world is an egomaniacal idiotic baby, the US is the laughing stock of the civilized world, and the GOP cowards in congress appear to be okay with it all. On the other hand, the citizens of the US are fine, the economy is still fine, protests have largely been peaceful, and I don't think we're gonna have a civil war, if that's what you mean. So overall, I'm not panicking just yet.

Overreacting how?
Overreactors gonna overreact. But the fact that the IC told Obama, Trump, gang of eight and that's it hints that it might be substantial. Or it might not...

Per the 2011 CBA, salary cap is a derivative of previous seasons revenues
Percentage 
Perfect call too
Perfect combination of (obviously deserved) American arrogance, total unprovability, and trolling the Euros 
Perfect example of us “studying Xs and Os” but then having no clue how difficult implementation is
Perfect execution
Perfect food to munch on as you yell at your TV that you could’ve made that catch
Perfect non capitalization Joe
Perfect. X1 Boston at 7
Perfection is the enemy of the good
Perhaps a tennis ball of justice 
Perhaps Anesto Cubano was campaigning for trump in Miami while partying with Chris brown
Perhaps groupme is buggy for me but 🤔 
Perhaps I will bring them as a party gift to your Not Invited To The Wedding Party
Perhaps I'll start running in Central Park or something  
Perhaps Iran thinks trump is so nuts that he might do things that Obama or Bush never would (which might be true). So they talk and act differently.
Perhaps it looked worse than it will end up being
Perhaps my viewing environment dampened the appeal if I’m the only one who didn’t like then
Perhaps we make a rule against trade backs in the same season 
Periscoped himself smoking weed except not his face but it's clearly him
Persian food is dank too
Personal take: he probably knew when he sent that letter that it would cost him his job. But he did it anyway. 
Personal take: no. Iran wants to demonstrate resolve to itself and to the region while also not escalating into US involvement.
Personal update if anyone cares: about 1/3 of the people here graduated last week, the JAGs and med officers. Tbh good fucking riddance, they were bringing the class down hard with both physical ability and morale. Shame there’s such a divide between the line officers and the non-combatant officers, but I guess that’s why they’re trying to integrate our training more. We also started to do more real military exercises and less classroom shit so that’s fun. Also I’m flight leader this week so i get to be under the microscope, but I also get to have my phone all week. 4 more weeks to go 💪🏼 
Personally I cannot wait to attend as many games as possible
Personally I hate Australian accents
Personally I hate debt so I pay off everything even if it might not be the “correct” decision
Personally I hate the softball strike zone. Plate should not be an auto ball. Shoulder height landing in the box should not be a strike
Personally I have ~40% of my investments in a 2055, plus an additional ~15% in the SP500
Personally I like technical breakdowns.  Stuff like X and O analysis on football and basketball plays is my favorite
Personally I love the “if Lebron and Tyreek etc played soccer the US would go undefeated” tropes
personally i love those posts because it means we get hot #ASMB content in here
Personally I think Sleepy Joe is gonna have a huge comeback, and he’s just Biden his time
Personally I think the term LGBT is transphobic because the B implies there are only 2 genders
Personally I think there should be a ceasefire here
Personally I’d vote against Georgetown because it’s inaccessible by metro
Personally I’m increasingly of the opinion that we should do away with keepers because they’ve made our league size plummet. Standard leagues are easier and joinable without a disadvantage.
Personally I’m really looking forward to Israeli Palestinian Arab Kurdish Persian appreciation month 
Personally I'm for shrinking requirements for a degree, and also proliferation of skill classes
Personally I'm still pro-Daz, but I wanted to hear the rest of the opinions, especially those who follow closely  
Personally Ive just thought he was full of shit (just like Don) since his breakout, and this just furthers that opinion 
Personally Marcus I never doubted you
Personally shocked that Faiz and Dr. Tanker aren’t incessantly posting about the successes against imperialism 
Personally, Halo 3 and CoD 4 were prob the most into video games I've ever been
Personally, I want a plan that is super low premium and basically doesn't pay for shit except if I have a tragic accident that would cost $10000
Personally, WNBA idgaf - late punishment added after the draft. SAT, take it by draft or be replaced.

Peyton Manning has completely carried gase’s career 
Peyton Manning mooned an athletic trainer in college as a prank in 1996. Basically swept under the rug. In 2003 she came out and said he put his ass and balls on her face (lmfao). Still swept under the rug. Last week, Shaun King of BLM notoriety wrote a column about it and smeared Peyton. Made a small blip on the public outrage radar, but nothing more. Discussion is why Peyton got away from it all so easily 
Peyton might’ve broken his TV
Peyton showing his true casual golfer status putting from 6 yards off the green
Peyton unprompted getting up and demonstrating fundamentals of play action bootleg. I cannot get enough
Peyton wins = more drama. Sorry Nooinglanders, I'm pulling for Mister Manning

Phew 16 yards for that AB pass
Phew glad that pick fell
Phew good thing the Union got you a raise!
Phew guess it's good timing for me to join the club
Phew I have an alibi. I often skip IG stories
Phew it’s been a long time since we’ve been reminded that the Kelleher Plan is the solution to all the country’s medical issues
Phew thought we had to send Marcus to the gulag for a second. What was the action?
Phew! I was worried I’d have to denounce
Phew. The unproblematic German flag
PHI should dominate the trenches on both sides. Theory is KC is gonna stack the box and play Hurts like he’s Lamar, forcing him to beat them with his arm. KC is gonna hit a lot of short middle of the field passes and a few PA deep routes
Phil is analytical with his shots but not like “I’m changing the whole game with my clubs and swing and methodology and I should be praised for it”
Phil with 2 bad fields reads so far. The pick into double coverage, then totally missing that wide open WR once he left the pocket and clearly was committed to run
Phil 👀

Philly fans are literally the worst. Cowboys are 1B to philly and also fuck jerry Jones. Redskins, fuck Snyder and their players hate their fans. GLOLants have okay but fair weather fans, and trash management.

Pitiful defense on both touchdowns 
Pitino? Coach K?
Pitt did a really good job of sniffing our our play actions, they seemed to always be there when it was a RB screen or bootleg or whatever
Pittsburgh is biggest diff in that they overperformed by an additional .7 wins in the adjusted vs unadjusted
Pittsburgh is correct

Play the song of time backward and it slows time down in half
Played a lot of draft dot com this year which is owned by fan duel 
Players play to win
Playing 9 right now. Paired with a mom and her 2 18 ish kids who’ve basically never played before. One kid finally connects a drive and crushes it. But then he can’t find his ball, and he’s looking 350 yards from the tee. I say hey man it’s probably back there. “No bro you see how hard I hit that?!” “Yeah but tiger woods doesn’t hit it this far.” “Bro I can hit it farther than tiger woods”
Playing devils advocate: in Europe, the increase in terrorist attacks has resulted in a far right nationalist and anti-Islamic wave across the continent. That’s what you get when the victims’ emotion makes decisions

Plus the 3-1 
Plus, always good to remember nobody notices anything ever
Plus, the players will want to be paid so that’s another game they get paid for
PnL fuck you
Point being, it's not unprecedented. Trump's being terrible at everything is unprecedented. 
Point being, throw 5 of those guys on the line and play press D. Not this prevent defense that Compton is suggesting 
Point I was making is that there's a legit candidate who people across the country are voting for that is the most legit protest vote since Nader. The count of votes for McMullin is salient figure, probably even more so than Nader actually
Point is under armor completely revamped their brand in 10 years and BC got in at the right time. It’s not impossible new balance can do it too
Point is we don't have one since Kuechly
Point is, your individual vote in the GOP primary means a lot, and if you care, you can do your part to stop Trump.

Political food for thought of the day: 
Politicians are such fuckheads
Politicians entire balance sheets should be public
Politicians when they try to talk sports to be relatable
Politifact is neutral and reliable, but not always the easiest to get a tldr on issues
Poll: do you guys know who chip and Joanna Gaines are
pollard and Etienne go at 3/4 turn. Have to imagine that rises 
Polls are showing kavanaugh is about as popular as trump (40-60, give or take). Interpretation of those polls is largely just conjecture at this point, IMO
Polls indicated Remain by a hair. It's currently Leave by a significant margin

Port Authority Bus Terminal is the worst place I’ve ever been

Port of Miami was an alright album. He had Stay Schemin and one other epic ass sounding song (forgot which). But yeah that's about it. And also Jeff he's a fat mothafucka with a big ass beard and is a former parole officer, so that adds to his personality
Port Washington
Portnoy
Portnoy is a total asshole whos entire life is being a 50 year old man who’s entire persona is making 20 year olds think he’s cool, and “I’m rich you’re a loser” is all he says when anybody disagrees with him
Portnoy would def leave the 28-3 game at halftime
Portnoy would definitely appear on Sputnik radio

Possible hot take: the breakfast club sucks 
Possibly 
Possibly becker if your credit score is good enough, but it will certainly have a low limit
Possibly better than Hawaii and Alaska but it’s close
Possibly but my team is in first place which your team has never been
Possibly but the Steelers were effective with backfield wheel routes all game. Lewis is the best at that
Possibly but TIL
Possibly but when the option to choose is there, I’m not gonna mail it in.
Possibly could’ve got 2 because the giants and Phillies were both super good when he was manager. No way other 2
Possibly even surpassing @B1G Buckeye Fan 
Possibly the nicest thing anybody has ever said to me. Certainly top 5
Possibly when he retires, but no
Possibly, but certainly not explicitly. There’s no leader and no unified calls for a goal, it’s just a general anti-China movement at this point. It started with an extradition bill that China passed that allowed China to prosecute people in HK, which the protestors took as a way for China to impose their laws over HK however they want. 
Possibly, but not explicitly 
Possibly/likely involved in a Massachusetts fetanyl and crack distribution ring

PPR is the way to go. Otherwise TDs are overvalued, old school ground and pound RBs are overvalued, and 1st down machine slot receivers are undervalued. And it's more fun because scoring is higher

Pretty good for a bellator card. Rory Mac and Michael Chandler are beasts. Lol Rampage vs Sonnen but somehow I’m interested
Pretty good hitter, fast as hell, sub average fielder. 
Pretty good. 4/4 Elite 8 picks so far
Pretty good. Definitely the mark to beat
Pretty good. Mentally I’m doing fine, which is the toughest part. Physically it’s a cinch. 4:30 AMs suck, we get yelled at constantly, and we aren’t allowed to talk most of the day, but it’s not bad if you’re able to just brush it off. Plus lots of people have families and kids they’re leaving at home, which makes it a lot easier to put in perspective for me. Classrooms are boring, but the activities are pretty fun.
Pretty incredible that as soon as they start giving Taylor a legitimate workload he instantly becomes a top tier RB
Pretty interesting actually. Game attendance + local media = 54% of revenue for MLB teams, way higher than MLB or especially NFL
Pretty interesting strategy to go all in on streaming a TV show that ended 7 years ago and can be bought on box set
Pretty much every single drive this game was exciting
Pretty much every time I’ve gotten laid has been with that line
Pretty much haha
Pretty much what I expected. This was low hanging fruit so Clay had easy pickings.
Pretty much yeah. Far from an eager endorsement, but equally far from what Cruz did
Pretty much, but a bit more like "we have this problem, how do we fix it?" And our solution is usually a piece of software
Pretty much, you guys got it
Pretty on brand so far
Pretty sad that ~25% of Americans believe these fucking things

Pretty sure It was designed for baseball
Pretty sure neither of us know anything about building aircraft carriers, but go off bro I respect the effort to die on this hill
Pretty sure nobody said it was an uninformed decision. It was just LOL GIANTS 
Pretty sure Ozzie Guillen fell for it twice in a season lmao
Pretty sure Portnoy also cheated on his wife 
Pretty sure she was in my freshman dorm
Pretty sure Terran dominates at the pro levels
Pretty sure the Beatles already wrote a song called the tariff man
Pretty sure they hung out at an Apple Store in Philly earlier this week
Pretty sure they issued a tornado warning 
Pretty sure this is Islamophobia 
Pretty sure we were one of the unlucky snubbed in our freshmen year
Pretty sure you can buy a Barrett M82 actually
Pretty surprised y’all didn’t love this one 
Pretty weak dick actually
Pretty wild that every late 2nd to late 3rd round RB has had some sort of negative development in the past couple weeks, except Derrick Henry
Preview of week 44:
Prez interviewed Don. Big Cat was not consulted because he probably would be against it, as he is strictly of the “no politics at barstool” mindset. He feels betrayed.

Probably because of equal levels of friendship
Probably because she's a vicious bitch with no cameras and she doesn't want to show that 
Probably because we’d dominate the Pats if we wanted to
Probably because you’ve never gotten it in 18. I for one like to keep everything 18 at highest, 19 is occasionally acceptable. 
Probably better to find a different guy saying the same thing and say you agree with him
"Probably bikes and Jesse Owen’s?

Probably Magmar for me, server crashed when I tried to catch
Probably not anymore. The regional Chinese thing hasn’t really been a thing since the 80s
Probably not but it would’ve been unique and huge for Cincinnati. Better than watching ND who got blown out by Clemson like 2 weeks ago
Probably not but it’s fuckin up there
Probably not gonna listen to NBA but I’ll give the others a shot 
Probably not huge for Dems since Hillary is still pretty much a lock

Probably, but he's hurt his own party. Basically he would be stealing votes from the Hillary pool, but not take as much from the Bernie pool. So Bernie would probably launch into first in Iowa and NH, and all of a sudden the Dem Establishment is playing from behind. It would be political suicide for Biden to enter now. 
Probably. Just not very much
Probably?
Probably? Never knoe for sure but yeah that time and place is the heart of the ISIS fight. And 2 deployments in 2 years is brutal either way
Problem is, as predicted, those who have lots of health problems are using Obamacare; those who don't are not. Therefore, the insurance companies now have way higher expenditures, which they make up for by charging higher premiums. And the coops are unable to stay solvent so they go under too
Problem there is, if it's still profitable and legal for companies to incorporate overseas, they will do so and hurt US GDP...
Problem: we share a room
Proctper maybe...

Putin is in too deep for a withdrawal to be palatable to him
Putin probably has had a massive boner for the entire month, and it's getting harder every day
Putin thinks he can manipulate Trump. Or at the very least, it will be more favorable for Putin to deal with Trump than Hillary
Putin's Russia exists to strengthen itself on the international stage (which I totally understand, wish America would do the same). But Russia sees NATO as the main barrier to that, which is true, so a weak NATO and an internationally weak US are keys to that goal. Having good relationships with Putin is meaningless when that is the elephant in the room.

He closes the drapes, but not the glass door and just lingers a sec. Connor says ""umm so that kid just showed up out of nowhere?"" Bill sticks his head in and says ""What?""
*awkwardturtle.gif*
Connor stumbles as he says ""uh, oh I mean like I'm just so impressed that you're willing to go to other RHA meetings outside of your group. It's very impressive"". Bill nods and eventually leaves. 

I still to this day feel the awkwardness that occurred in those 30 seconds."

Niners can’t practice or play at home

Basically, it says if girls are at risk of sexual violence on campus, allowing a transgender into the girls locker room is a breach of Title IX and illegal. But, not allowing that transgender to use the girls locker room is against the new law and also illegal.

Re: QB evaluation, I think one of the things that makes it so hard to evaluate a QB from the top tier schools is that their teams are so good, they rarely have to put the team on their backs. Their blocking is top notch and their receivers regularly toast DBs. QBs who have to do it all earlier may be able to show that ability more frequently.

Read more about the war today and a lot of FP experts I trust are postulating that Putin doesn’t know what to do, but is abjectly refusing to diplomatically end the war, and therefore currently focused on just seizing as much Ukrainian territory as possible in the near term. IMO this means Russia is already set up to fail, because operating with no strategic end game never works. And Russia still hasn’t demonstrated the ability to conduct effective tactics (air superiority, combined arms, logistics, command and control etc), let alone their inability/unwillingness to conduct urban warfare and seize a single major city.

Real rapist is a rapist. Me and goody and others have witnessed him raping and/or attempting to rape on a number of occasions. We'd always point him out when he was around. Unfortunately, there's an ordinary fellow named Tom Dodge who has the misfortune of looking like said rapist. Me and goody incorrectly identified Tom as the rapist for months, until we saw them both at the same time and realized our mistake. Now Tom has been upgraded to fake rapist, and rapist has been correctly identified as real rapist.

Reddit was going off on flopping in the Neymar gif thread yesterday. Sorta confirmed what John said about certain leagues/cultures (Italy, Latin America) doing it wayyyy more than others (Japan v Belgium yesterday). But i guess it often happens 2+ times a game, taking a few minutes each time. Then of course they’re all totally fine when the game resumes. They were also talking about how if Brazil is up in the second half, theyll flop to delay time.

Question is, do you believe the track will right itself without issue, or do some concrete actions need to be taken?

Respectable answer
Restart the season, who’d you rather have: Tom Brady or Kirk Cousins?
Resting is super important, IMO. That said, I believe the Warriors were not wrong to go for 73-9 mainly because of Draymond. That dude was the heart and soul of the team during the regular season, and I think if the Warriors decided to rest instead of chase it, Dray would've been upset and maybe even a bit demotivated, and it would've rubbed off on the team

Right right, there should be some regulation. But say you've been to your primary clinic several times over years. You should be able to get a prescription without the cost of a doctors visit, which can essentially surmount to another $100+ for a 5 minute visit to get a prescription 
Right right. I have a Roth 401k then
Right so Drew Brees was revolutionary, but IMO not one of the best QBs of all time and rather overrated 
Right so even though Bortles got to the AFC Championship, it’s not a good strategy
Right so the point of the thread is from a civic perspective. From a patient health/hospital perspective, it’s unambiguously better to be vaccinated. But we don’t regulate drinking, smoking, weight, etc
Right so the question is: Does 6-9 wins a year suffice? Or do we need 8-10 wins a year or fire the coach?
Right you can register with a party by those deadlines. 
Right, a torrent is basically just a location to access data. The actual data is somewhere else. Vuze gives you a way to download the actual data through the torrent.

Right, because that was in the primary
Right, but I'd expect to be getting laid and not having to jerk off...
Right, but I've jacked off to them fucking on camera first, which distinguishes them from the other prostitutes
Right, but that two sides is limited to things that aren’t taken as gospel
Right, but then there’d be random accounts making memes too. Not just all the big ones at the same time  
Right, but you have a balls load of Pokemon prepped for evolution. That's like being in second with Leveon Bell and Antonio Brown scheduled to be activated next week
Right, that's why you wanna have a conspirator come in when the count is high, bet big, and leave. Right?
Right. And the currency is tennis balls
Right. If you have an equation and you're trying to prove it, you want it as close to 1 as possible
Right. So if I sell now, I’ll be under that 38 guaranteed. If I wait, it’s gonna be over the cusp. But if I immediately reinvest, does that change anything
Right. When in doubt, get mad at the corporations. I’m learning, I’m learning. 
Right. Which is exactly what I said 7 messages ago
Right... it's almost as if the "extreme vetting" he repeatedly talks about should be applied to himself

Rubio Cruz and Carson on one. Bush and Kasich on another. Trump has his own. 
Rubio for SecState and Mike Waltz for NatSec Advisor are good picks IMO, like as good as I could realistically ask for. 
Rubio is a huge cuck 
Rubio is the most at risk from this and it's not close. Pundits thought he had a shot at WINNING NH. The debate really really hurt him
Rubio was always good with words. actions, not so much...
Rubio was in the best position to do well in the late states, but Carsons voters seemingly all went to Cruz. The fact that Carson dropped out and Kasich didn't halted the #marcomentum hard. And Kasich continues to handicap Rubio badly (although at this point it's probably better for him to stay in than not in order to prevent Trump from winning Ohio and Michigan).

Russia
Russia has changed its strategy to conducting slow plodding operations in the south and east, basically preparing for a long war. They think they can sustain ops longer than Ukraine is willing or able to. They are likely hoping western support will fade over time. So the best case scenario is probably that western support instead continues and increases, and Russia is slowly attritted to the point where they believe continued operations are not worth it.
Russia hasn’t had a positive development in 6 months. This will not buck the trend 
Russia is an enemy of the United States. Fuck "good relationships".

Same story in GA 7 and possibly GA 6 (#tbt to Jon ossoff) 
Same story with gillibrand really. CNN / MSNBCs coverage of the candidates will be the most important factor IMO 
Same story with trump: I simultaneously am shocked by and am not surprised at all about how disgusting his actions are
Same study has total LBGT at 3.5% 
Same teacher also made a deck of cards that were anti Bush administration and went on the oreilly factor to defend them

Sanctions are laws to restrain or cease economic cooperation with the sanctioned bodies. So say NATO/EU sanctions a Russian bank, banks and businesses in NATO/EU will freeze the sanctioned accounts and cease doing any business until they are lifted. TBD if they will work
Sanders gonna win NH by 2%
Sanders is as toxic as trump to many of the swing voters, so he’s unquestionably the best candidate for trump to face. It’s why trump himself is promoting sanders on twitter if you can believe that
Sandlot, field of dreams, remember the Titans

Sasse retiring rumors @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim 
Sat next to a dude at a bar yesterday who was the most degenerate gambler I'd ever met.  He had like $20000 on the super bowl in combined bets, then had like $1000 on college basketball games on that night
"SAT punishment (upcoming season)

Keep SAT: Jordan, Becker

Saw
Saw “Israel is not a real country”, “from the river to the sea” several times, a bunch of variations of “colonizers are not civilians” or something of the sort.
Saw a vid on Reddit where Chris Broussard was trashing Avery Bradley for letting Devon Harris put up 70 on him. Bradley didn't play in that game.
Saw my cousin Vinny recently for the first time in like a decade. Great Flicc
"Saw on Twitter:

Worth a reminder: Leaving the EU does not mean that Britain cannot negotiate agreements with the EU. The US has agreements with the EU.  It does mean, however, that the UK gets to run those agreements through its own parliament, and choose which it wants."
Saw that earlier and immediately saved the pic
Saw the Michael Jackson musical on Friday night. It was pretty good
Saw this earlier. Watched it 4 times 
Saw this on the road today lmao
Saw this online, supposedly based on current strength of roster
Saw this this morning. Back to back games with ACC darling Miami getting absolutely bailed out by the refs 🤔 
Saw this yesterday but still appalled by the classlessness
Sawyer squeeze but basically the same thing 
"Say each attempt is 50/50. And assume you hold and score again (otherwise it doesn’t matter)

50%: Success, win
25%: Fail, succeed second time, go to OT
25%: fail twice, lose

Vs kicking which is 100% OT"
Say he runs at 10 min pace and walks at 20 min pace. The question is what’s the ratio?
Say the same thing about Uighurs for suee
Say there’s an 8 foot barrier 
Say you start at half, if it breaks you go one up from floor 1. If it doesn't you start from half plus 1 and go up
Say you take PCP or meth and go nuts and start assaulting people
Say you’re wearing jeans, you walk up to the urinal, then what. Go step by step
Say you're wearing jeans and you go pee at a urinal? Do you unbutton your pants and pull down the underwear elastic and go, or unzip and go through both fly holes? Or some combination of the two?
Says he probably could’ve gone pro if he’d played on high school
SB Nation had a "why it makes sense to trade Collins" column yesterday, one comment said "I think BB is just trying to pull increasingly batshit moves and laugh when you writers praise them as genius"
SB Nation wrote a long SJW article on how it's a big deal Brissett is a black starting QB in a historically super racist city 🙄

Scapegoating insurance is a ruse by Big stethoscope to distract from them being the reasons for high costs
Scheduling rides would be great. At that point it has the main feature of cab service. Might be some issues from the drivers' side, but yeah that would be big
Schefter saying Niners are gonna offer Shanahan 6 years too. Lot of eggs in that basket
Schilling actually did an AMA recently. Fortunately stayed away from politics, except he did say "I don't care who you sleep with as long as you can hit with RISP"
Schools and their athletic sponsors (e.g. Louisville and Adidas) bribe athletes to commit to a school, coax them into signing with an agent, financial advisor, and sponsor when they go pro. They launder the money through AAU programs, amongst other things.

Scouting report clearly said first pitch swing
Scramble? So best ball every shot?
Scratch the 3 and 3. You swap 2 from each abnormal group with the normal group. Then you'll narrow down the abnormal group to 4
Scratchers... Wow that's low man
Screw Bama, we want Euclid!
Screw that we’re getting the good vibrations group
Scroll up somewhere I said Dak was the bet at +2000
Scroll up to Joes post. He posts things like that all day. He's a "social media aggregator", aka reposter from Reddit and other sites

Seager is having a better year but if you actually would take him over trout to build a franchise you’re a retard
Seahawks being classless again. Jags fans responding in kind lol
Seahawks must think they have Watson in the bag
Seahawks needed to move on from Geno, can’t have QB who is a multi team bust who had one insane year before regressing back into mediocrity  
Seahawks punter
Seahawks super bowl deja vu
Sean McDermott relying on a “Khalil Al Shakir” to carry the team in crunch time 🤔 
Sean McVay is super interesting because he saw the advantage of play action flood concepts. They dominated the NFL, then got figured out. Question remains if he can innovate again. 
Sean Payton tests positive
Sean Penn
Sean Penn is like the liberal Donald Trump
Search isn’t working but I want to reply to my message during game 2 where I said the opponent goes on a tear to cut the lead to like 4 then the Cs go up 10 effortlessly in the next 2 mins 
searching your coworkers on FB. You send a message asking what she’s gonna major in?
season 1 was definitely better than season 2. But that’s how these things always are
Season 1 was one of the best shows I’ve ever watched 
Season 2 isn’t out yet but the reviews say it’s very good  
Season is over for me. I'm playing for next year 
Season matters so much
Season over. Fuck football

SEC + Big Ten acquire all the biggest teams then declare autonomy from the rest of the NCAA. College sports continues to head in a not great direction. 
SEC just blowing it game after game
Second best player of all time
Second bomb in NYC went unexploded, accidentally defused by thieves who took the suitcase and left the bomb. The detonator was a cell phone that was traced back to the perp
Second consecutive year of this...
Second half at least
Second half has been kind to pats fans hearts so far
Second hardest punch I’ve ever seen
Second in GPI, last place. Then fire sale. Now I’m in a fairly comfortable position coming into next year
Second most drafted player in best ball 💪🏼
Second of all, I told her that for a pessimist, im pretty optimistic. But I still don’t see this going anywhere. I’ll pay for your Uber tho. 
Second part is right. First part is partially right. Obamacare forces everybody to have insurance (or be fined), and therefore there must be an insurance company somewhere that accepts the worst (highest risk) patients. Those patients are subsidized by insurance co-ops. The insurance companies are incurring more losses (and in turn raising premiums), and the co-ops are spiraling into debt. 
Second part not sure if I agree with lol. Tax dodging is rampant worldwide...
Second question: you know how it's bullshit if someone plays a game but then leaves at halftime? What I'm saying is old people shouldn't be allowed to vote
Second thought, gotta move the dragons down to 6th. That logo would not look good on a helmet
Second time refs have tried to screw over Terry and rig the fix for the chiefs
Second time we were chased down and prevented a TD
Second to Barry Bonds and the HOF, the Zesty Boi FLB snub is the most egregious of all time
Sectarian?

See he specifically mentions and condemns a bunch of Muslim scholars who "sold their deen," i.e. are moderates and don't call for Sharia.  The empowerment and support of those types of Muslims is where you start
See I don’t follow her. Wasn’t lying about not knowing her IG
See I don't like these ifs, that's why I want an unambiguous rule
See I guess I’m unconvinced by the above at this point since it might still just be a smear campaign, and the whole innocent until proven guilty thing
See I think it’s more having ground attack threat in general, not necessarily a good RB in a run first offense
See I thought it was funny because nobody did that in Galway or Ennis, then in cork everybody did. Dublin was more mixed
See I used to laugh at the elliptical arm runners too, but then I realized that's actually a legit workout if you use 90% arms haha
See if you can get unpaid leave
See it’s not that hard to not strike out in little league
See now you're talking. There's $100 million 
See that's the beauty of CoC. Whip out your phone for no more than 4 minutes, that's all you need. 
See the Trump campaign is currently spending $0 in campaigning in swing states thus far? #TheBestPeople
See this is a weird mindset to me that this is just normal
See trump does it and it's effective even though it's a dumb argument
See what is the "Oscar Best Picture mold"? I get that it's probably not Fast and Furious 47, but it shouldn't give extra points to stuff like The Artist for being a black and white silent film in the 2000s.  But I also don't really give a shit so they can do what they want.
see with diabetes, that shit controls your life. Have to monitor yourself constantly, take weird meds... With gluten you can just decide to stop having a made up disease whenever you want.

Seems about as normal as Biden
Seems expensive
Seems fair enough. I don't really feel strongly about it.
Seems kinda fishy that Joe "Don Jr" Bourque and Ryan "Julian Assange" Darrow are releasing their messages now that it seems they have nothing to lose 🤔
Seems like a "you show me your dick, I'll show you this classified info" kind of deal
Seems like a good policy. Gonna suck for renters tho
Seems like a pretty #good game to me
seems like a pushback on the health at every size BS
Seems like a reach. Take another OL
Seems like all of them are smallish markets with competitors nearby 
Seems like hinch got dis dirty. Report says he repeatedly voiced his disapproval of the whole thing, but since he didn’t shut it down, he gets fired and suspended
Seems like if Biden runs, he’s got it locked up. People still worship anything that smells like Obama
Seems like it, but idk really. I honestly don't know the difference between RPM, Adj RPM, PER, and WAR without looking it up.
Seems like joe hates America 
Seems like online betting could be an entire branch of law at this point 
Seems like open 3s weren’t falling for both teams. There was that stretch in the late 1st where the Cavs missed like 4 open 3s in a row
Seems like rampant abuse of patients by the scientific community. Smh “protect and serve” my ass
Seems like Rubio / Kasich do well amongst Reps living where Dems exist too. Trump and Cruz are killing it where the whole state is bible thumpers
Seems like somebody’s been brushing up on reading...
Seems like something that could lead to a false flag, and “we were beginning our demobilization but then Ukraine attacked us so now we must defend ourselves and they’re the aggressor”
Seems like the ruling is that the federal government spent money on Obamacare that it didn't have authority to spend (that right?). So now what? What's actually gonna happen (assuming it's upheld if appealed). 
Seems like the union fees are more than the bonus 
Seems like there’s a real vacuum for BC Football journalism that could be exploited
Seems like there’s only one appropriate response
Seems like we all agree access to care is a human right, given someone is willing to give it. But also that nobody can be compelled to give it.
Seems right
Seems right to me
Seems to me he's about as good as Jay Cutler

Semi Pro was the only obscure one of those, IMO
Semi related, new favorite Trump quote:
Semi-hot take: Russ signs with the Spurs next offseason, creating a Russ, Lamarcus, Kawhi super team that takes over the league.
Senate is. Most models had the Dems taking control at 50/51 seats. That still seems plausible  
Senator from CA. Supposedly a charismatic mainstream Dem but far too "big govt that should be like your second family" for me

Send this to Donny since he’s clearly itching for a more high stakes fantasy sports experience
Senior analyst is the sweet spot
Senior Management would basically be the client. It'd be up to them to manage their BAs
Senior year Emyr had a secret girlfriend that nobody knew about until she put a big “good luck” poster on our mod wall before his LSAT
Senior year softball and senior day dodgeball
"Senior year we were playing butts up. Becker had BUT, fumbled the ball, ran toward the wall, and was clearly out by a full step. As it has been for decades, the punishment is a tennis ball thrown at your backside. 

Ostensibly terrified by the excruciating pain of the impending projectile (I emphasize again, a tennis ball), Andrew “George Constanza” Becker vehemently denies being out, then rage quits because everybody else is cheating. 

Sometime over the next 3-6 months, Becker admits that mayhaps he was in fact out, and perchance he was dishonest. The jury swiftly deemed him guilty on all counts, and he received his sentence. 

12 additional months later, he finally received his justice, delivered via a tennis ball thrown from point blank range at 40-45 mph."

Separate situation 
Separate the markets
Separately, a Ukrainian newspaper has allegedly doxxed the entirety of the Russian invasion force. 120,000 personnel
Separately, assuming you agree that the US presence was good for the average Afghan, the argument is basically “we shouldn’t continue stabilizing this country because it’s too expensive”

Serious Q, Has attending Berkeley changed your political views at all?
Serious question that I’ve asked John, when did she become so... lame? 
Serious question, did the tea party ever get violent?
Serious question. Would you rather have Russ or Daniel Jones? same price
Serious question: do you think harsher punishments actually deter NFL players from these assaults/batteries? 
Serious question: Do you think kickers play a slice or a fade
Serious question: who would you have as your QB for the next 3 seasons, Brock or Bradford?
Serious suggestion though: Head Coaches. Points for team win, margin of victory, upset win, etc. 
Serious Tip: embellish the hell out of yourself. I.e.: if you were involved with a project, say you were the leader.
Seriously don’t understand why John didn’t try to become an airline pilot
Seriously, how do you complain about being in debt then not release your album on iTunes? Fuck. Kanye. 
"Seriously, look at their rotation:

Shaun King and Deray are going at it on twitter and it is amazing #WokeOff
SHAUN LIVINGSTON AHHHHHHHH
Shaw AFB is in SC 
She alleges he did, but also declined to press charges both times 
She also says your clubhead speed is slow
She also wasn’t a child molester
She always made it clear that it was you inviting her
She apparently never graduated from Antioch University undergrad
She asked him hard questions during the first debate
She bought herself some DSLs 
She can get it
She can get it
She definitely sucks a terrible dick
She doesnt look great there 🫤 
She goes by taylor SWIFT because her songs never miss
She got a trail name in like a week?
She grew up in pentos 
She hated Johnny o malley too I remember 
She hit an intentional ball for a walk off??
She hit me with the “what are we” and I was like “well I’m gonna deploy soon and i don’t wanna lead you on and say this thing is gonna last.” And she got all quiet and weird and left shortly after.
She is so bad. He is so bad. We are all fucked
She laughed
She looks familiar but I have no idea from where 
She looks like a pornstar hahaha
She looks like she’d give an enthusiastic BJ
She miiiiight take it from the back. Like 40% chance
She needs a good dicking
She probably just didn't like me. That's happened before. 
She quit her fantasy league last minute claiming she “told her pit boss multiple times” instead of just texting the groupme 
She rhymes McGraw with song and long, so Toby Keith doesn't quite work
She said about you “he’s really hot but he needs a new haircut”
She said something snarky to me and I said you already used your chirp about the sign, which prompted the above
She says it’s a miracle you scored the wife that you did 
She should’ve listened to Pete Carroll, Todd gurley, and co and made a plan to vote
She sounds disabled alright
She sounds like a 12 year old professor umbridge 
She sounds like Cynthia from the homeowners association in the geico commercial
She was a BWW waitress @Endowed Department Chair Of Asstronomy 
She was a top notch rebounder
She was all “Chirp?! What you can’t handle a WOMAN telling you blah blah blah”. And I’m like “uh no I use that all the time” and Joe and jac are like “no that’s a commonly used word. And I’m like “oh so you’re accusing me of being sexist for no reason at all” and I said some derivative of that like 6 times until she’s like “LOOK IM SORRY. LET IT GO”
She was exposed by the Panama papers 
She was famous for that freshmen year
She was hot in punta. Y’all can attest.
She was in my honors class frosh and soph year and one time she saw me out with Lexi and in the next class was like “why didn’t you tell me you had a gf, I wanted to date you” like extremely straightforward 
She was white
She wasn’t doing her part of the burglary well
She went abroad to Parma right? I'm pretty sure I met her there.
She went for the high point on the fade route right there
She’s 21 now btw
She’s a giants fan so we have that
She’s about to hit Scotts Tots and I’ve been waiting for this moment for weeks 
She’s genuinely a crazy scary woman
She’s gonna be a Trail Ten that’s for sure
She’s just a winner. Dominating in the arena, surrounded by haters
She’s not the star on the eyes
She’s one of the dumbasses who gets RT’d by Don because she licks his orange balls but would otherwise be laughed off the planet
Shea Serrano move right there lol
Shedeur checks the L and B boxes pretty well
Shefter and Wojnarowski
Shefty has trended downhill since the Incognito fiasco
Shefty is saying Cobb or Jordy might be released or asked to take a pay cut because they’re both on the last year of 40/39 MM deals
Shelbiecowart still got that gray arrow. Apparently Marcus was never my friend
Shenanigans. Gobbledygook. Pick your own colorful word 
Sherlock
Sherzer rangers?!
She's adorable but she sucks
She's also an anti-feminist so that makes her cooler
She's an escort though that doesn't count 
She's def a virgin right?
She's had a crush on Emyr for quite a while
She's like 0/20 in appealing to young voters by "being cool"
She's like the browns 
She's like the definition of the perfect hate fuck
She's like the Ted Cruz of the Democrats: very smart, overly extreme partisan, and has a dislikable demeanor
She's not bad at explaining. She's really bad at being aggressive
She's not. Just there's one scene from true detective that's awesome and sexy. And I want Kate Mara to do a similar scene
She's probably finger blasting herself to the "John Thompson added you to a groupme" notification that I hope she got
She's saying "fiscal policies like the Kelleher Plan", but the gif cuts off after the first word 
Shh

Shitty end to an incredible Game
Shitty how these loan companies know that once the deal is made, they're gonna get their money but the debtor is screwed. I think that's what leads to students taking out these $100K+ loans to get worthless degrees
Shitty. 10 months now
Shitty. I'm now on a Goldman Sachs project and my boss is an Asian Brit, so he's both ridiculously hardworking and a demanding prick. Thanks for asking though :)
Shocked that Alamogordo isn’t on the list

Short answer no. But the system does show how many other people ranked a job as their top 1, in top 3, and interested at all
Short answer: no
Short answer: yes. More true answer, the GOP revealed to be not nearly as homogenous and compatible as it appeared, and the pols still don't know how to deal with that
Shortchanged in terms of how much your individual vote matters in determining your states electoral votes?

Sidebar: who from Boston is driving up to VT that I can possible hitch a ride from?
Siemian 4 consecutive great plays
Siemian has thrown a max of 3 yards downfield 
Sigh come on man it's getting old
Sign AI. Why the fuck not?
Sign was about the bills 
"Sign with the Dodgers, instantly do terrible/illegal shit

Silicon Valley guy is down there
Silly goodwin, you're not paying extra taxes. You're paying a higher monthly premium on the health insurance that you're mandated to have.
Silver lining if there’s no season: at least the dodgers and Yankees won’t win
Simian looks better than I ever would've imagined 
Similar to that. I got selected as an officer candjdate for the USAF. Sometime in ~6 months, I am going to 10 weeks of officer training school at Maxwell AFB in Montgomery Alabama. If I pass, I graduate as a 2nd LT
Similar to the zero new corona cases, Chinese companies never lose any money
Similar vein idk if any of y’all have been following SBNation but CA passed a law that independent contractors must be hired as employees, which SBN heralded. so, SBN fired all its independent contractors, via twitter lol
Similarly Marcus getting spladled
Similarly the founder of cashapp got murdered in SF last night, but hey that’s just life in SF sometimes
Simone biles culture war is the worst culture war
Simple case of denial and error
"Simple macro answers: Inflation was bad. Trump’s reputation is a good businessman. Kamala being a woman doesn’t help. 

More news informed answers: Biden was a walking corpse and the Dems lied to our faces. Kamala was anointed without a challenger and dislikable as proven in the 2020 primaries. 

More culture answers: People hate being lectured to, and that’s a core piece of the Dem platform nowadays. Illegal immigration is perceived to be a problem. Crime is perceived to be a problem. "
Simple supply and command 
Simplest solution: make college cheaper. #KelleherPlan2
Simpsons and South Park top 2 all time tho. But Bobs Burgers is really underrated
Simpsons last night was about how everybody gets participation trophies. At the epilogue of the episode, the Sixers draft Ralph Wiggum because he leads the nation in basketball trophies
Since I’ve lost a month off it already
Since it’s so one sided and all at +1000
Since the link failed miserably 
Since the Ray Rice scandal they're like 0/8
Since then, he has intermittently resurfaced online (notably in 2014 and 2019), where his personality appears to have not changed a bit. Claims include going to the NFL and the Olympics, amongst the other lines in the above screenshot. 
Since there was a significant increase in homerun rates this year across the league
Since they have 2
Since we’re on QB evaluation 
Since we're all sucking our own dicks I'll brag that I'm the #ChampionOfJustice by defeating both Goody the cheater and Becker the Liar. I also deserve the title of #WagerMaster after twice defeating the prior gambler extraordinaire. Thirdly I deserve the Miley Cyrus award because I #CameInLikeAWreckingBall and wreaked havoc on the league right off the bat. 
Since were on the topic, doctors what’s your takes on the opioid crisis and it’s relation to prescriptions?
Since you can't vote for Cowboys OL, I'd vote Brady, then Rodgers, then Landon Collins

Skins got off by the skin of their teeth too
Skins should’ve used this opportunity to claim Kareem Hunt and sign Colin Kaepernick. Already signed Foster so the rep can’t get much worse, and the Kap haters don’t care about DV. But the Kap stans would be thrilled and have to acknowledge that, so the good and bad press might be a wash
Skip the cheese Jeff. You’re a health guy now 
Skips whole thing is so clearly shtick and I think he half enjoys being the target of hatred
Skrong back, weak arms
Skycam allowed me to see the jump route before the pick. Thanks skycam

Smith was garbage because singletary was garbage 
Smith would be the only other choice

Snickers is the baseline for Grade-A candy bar.  I always compare a new one to a snickers, rarely beats it.
SNL has gone down the tubes in the past 10 years. Same with CNN and Sports Illustrated
So @Bo Jerk sign me up for fall intramurals 
So @Cod-Bod: The Trivia Master  @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD  y'all are the only others interested in music sharing so we can just make a spotify playlist or something
So @Daz 4 Prez if you throw in another player that fits Goodwin's definition of "valuable enough" we can push this thing through
So @JustFacts✅ we on $5:$50
So @The Big Dick Bandit we can hang out
So 1)yes, and 2) no. That’s fair and basically what I expected 
So 100,000:1? I'd take that bet
So 4 total. Idk if that's the minimum, but it works
So 40 and 49 yards are always in the same category
So 80 vs 10
So a few things can happen from here: 1) Doctors don't accept insurers who have Obamacare ties. 2) The insurers don't deal with Obamacare patients. 3) The coops all go under, effectively killing Obamacare organically. 4) The government keeps supporting Obamacare with taxes / debt. 
So actually since 2009, then 2007 if you include coffee.
So aircrew plus 100-150 paratroopers 
So all 3 of you who listen to every episode were against the pick. FUCK YO NARRATIVE, FUCK YO BUZZ KILLINGTON ASS, and FUCK #JUSTFACTS
So all it is is a public open source ledger?
So all prime numbers between 1 and 1000 stay open, except for 2 and 3. That's the first step
So am I gonna get a recap of bock boi Bach bonanza or what
So angry I’m messing up my there’s 
So anyway, he loses his mind soph year and leaves, goes on his epic rant, then continues to be public on FB about how he's not crazy, but still makes all these ridiculous claims about running a 4.4, etc. Ends up just going AWOL...
So Apple literally has you by the balls 
So are Bates' and Daz's jobs secure now that BC has made a bowl game despite 0 performances to be proud of?
So are we blue balled for the Chris Chan hate list
So are we penciling in 4/22-23?
So are you def uninterested in returning?
So are you not gonna tell the story?
So as an officer, enlisteds are required to salute me anytime I pass them walking, which prompts me to return their salute. Omg talk about something that was kinda cool the first time and gets so old so fast. I literally return 100 salutes a day
So as usual, the pundits are the real lunatics
So at every branches basic training, we are famously screamed at incessantly in order to teach us to keep our composure under stress. I wonder if cops get any sort of similar training. Sure seems like it would help about now. 
So at this point seems like this is the most likely map
So bad passes and drops are treated no differently than every other attempt
So basically a "hey thanks for being our workhorse back and probably underpaid for 5 years, here's 100k" bonus
So basically all of med school is working toward getting a good residency?
So basically are you good enough of a skater and puck handler to avoid 12 stick lifts without losing control? If so, you should be in the NHL
So basically if you make the bigs, baseball is better than football
So basically it was straight business from the get go. Go in, she pulls the drape shut, takes me to this tiny back room with literally just a bed. I am very drunk and also high, so I'm having some trouble here if you know what I mean. She jokes and laughs about it, then puts a rubber on my softie and starts BJing me with it on, which does literally nothing. I'm sitting there trying my best with slow but eventual success. Basically spent 15 of the 20 or so mins trying to get it up, then 5 mins of action where I'm being too nervous and gentle and she's clearly faking everything and must be bored. She tells me to hurry up, I do. We put our clothes on and I leave and she goes back to the window. 
So basically say “aww that’s alright” and do nothing?
So basically the same reason people hate Peyton Manning?
So BC dominated? Sorry Jeff
So becker tomorrow might be last time I see you in a very long time
So Becker you’re literally full of shit?
So bet a $beer that he’s not a top 36WR ROS?
So bills Steelers will play 2x more times than scheduled? 
So Bloomberg apparently has hired a bunch of the most popular IG meme accounts to post memes DMs from him, making fun of his attempts to make himself look cool
So by that standard, is JJ vindicated??
So call me an electrical engineer, I’m good with the battery 
so chan is the culprit
So Chris, you're the weird one ;)
So clearly that rule doesn't hold water 
So Cleveland is cool but New York is not because New York is already too rich, and people will get priced out of New York but not out of Cleveland?
So Clowney has 100% lived up to his hype, right?
So Colangelo has a legit alibi for at least one (and therefore probably all) of the accounts. The Eric Jr one was actively tweeting while BC was mid press conference. However, the #1 suspect is now MRS Colangelo, and her phone number last 2 digits matches up with the accounts’
So columns C and D are equal
So Cornell creeps up in the power rankings
So cum boi
So Darrow and goody are you buying tickets?

So either he recovers without surgery or he misses half a season
So either he truly thinks he’s innocent, or the demanded money was so massive he’d rather fight it in court
So even if he loses PA and GA, his win of NE-2 pushes him over the edge 
So even year. So sexy. 
So every wave is a new variant?
So everybody,  if you wanna sell the farm, this year is the last year you may do so
So far 100% of people have thought that
So far a country’s success at combatting corona appears to be purely due to social factors, and extremely little (if at all) due to any healthcare factors
So far biggest story is that Trump supporters don't vote
So far he's pivoting hahaha. Called Barry O a "very good man" after calling him a terrible person and a Muslim born in Kenya for 8 years...
So far hes said he is refusing muellers subpoena, Carter Page colluded with the Russians, Trump totally knew about that secret meeting in the trump tower, and Sarah Huckabee sanders is a fat slob 
So far I know: Nan, Caila Quinn
So far I think Trump is "winning" relative to expectations. Hillary is on the defensive too much, like she can't help but defend every attack instead of ignore it and counterattack
So far I'm 1-0 in contests involving Posa 
So far in 2021, Jeff is 2/2 in coming at me 
"So far it’s playing out to be the urban
Meyer hire of world cups. Everybody knew it was going to be a disaster but it’s got strong potential to be even worse "
So far MA people are Digletts 9-2-1, but CA people are Fence Hoppers 5-1-0
So far the facts are that 1) he’s a beast on offense in the right system which is a PnR centric offense that revolves around him, and 2) he’s by definition a mediocre player in every other situation. Everything else is conjecture 
So far this is going exactly as everybody expected
So far tiger missed a ~6 foot par putt on 2 to go down 1. He also lost closest to the pin by 40 feet on 6 for $100K
So far we got 2 solid prelim fights. Add Ryan "Reynolds" Darrow vs Joe "Crossfit" Bourque to round out the heavyweight class and we got a full card
So far we have Marcus and Darrow in the bullpen. Anyone else?
"So far: 
Bruce- Joe
Danielle- Me
Harambe- Kevin
Jacquizz- Marcus
Schindler - Becker"
So fingers crossed for the playoffs to Happen
So fingers crossed I don’t have to miss Marcus’s wedding
So for example with 50, you start at (7+1) 8, 15, 22, 29, etc
So fucking soft
So fundamentally change college sports as we know it
So funny that the Dems have bent over backwards to patronize to non-whites (except Asians) for 20 years, then the non-whites (except Asians) start swinging to the GOP
So funny. He threw on the headset and the instincts just kicked in
So general viewership?
So generous of you Marcus. Below his ESPN projected value and all
So given your understanding of the situation, who should've gone to prison?
So good
So goodwin you basically laid out my rationale, since I was desperate for RB and deep at WR
So Goody, on Dec 25 when people say Merry Christmas to you, do you tell them "fuck off I know what day it is"
So GT, NCST, Cuse and Wake are going to be the season determining games
So guys what was your favorite moment of James' 6 day(?) tenure with the groupme?
So he can learn to build that wall early 
So he can't save himself, but if he calls out Joe's strategy, everybody else is saved
So he has no excuse
So he shouldn't get in because his words offend you
So he’s writing these same-universe, different story novellas and hoping the answer comes to him
"So health is obviously out the window. So Ill go with:
Chick Fil A Chicken Biscuits
In N Out Double Double Animal Style
Chipotle steak bowl "
So Henry’s gonna get the tag, but then he probably walks in FA (unless another tag). And they have AJ Brown on the rookie deal. Idk what their contract situation for the OL is but this is a lot of commitment without a lot of other weapons
So how can this change. Or have we reached the Nash equilibrium 
So I agree with becjer
So I call your coworker a tankie because he’s parroting the communist government propaganda because he hates America, while Cuba is communist and anti-America so de facto the good guy 
So I can still brush. Yeah I take the non-floss and the non itchy asshole
So I can tell them that next time they call asking for donations 
So I clogged the toilet and flooded the bathroom on my second night in my new apartment. How are your mondays going?
So I got schwasty and lost my phone last night, just got a new one. Recovered all my data except... Clash of Clans. Hello TH1 
So I guess I’ve had that 
So I guess my vote is no it’s not early on, but it is at the end
So I guess the one takeaway is that there is zero evidence that anything is trending in Dons favor at all
So I have 3 poliwags now. I can basically just release the other two since I already have their candy?
So I just wanna acknowledge that Pusha T literally diss track bullied Drake into not being a complete deadbeat dad
So I just watched the second half of the OJ special and my god that guy is a fucking lunatic
"So I packed a bag and sent it with a friend who’s driving to goodfellow, but he’s not arriving until later this afternoon. And I just remembered I packed my boots in there... 

So basically my career as an Intel Officer is off to a great start  "
So I think he’s actually gonna do the marathon but just walk every other mile
So I think he’s cheaper Jimmy G 
So I think I'm good to get fucked up tonight 
"So I think it goes like this:

Darrow 100%
John: win, or Becker loss, or Jaime loss
Becker: win, or Jaime loss
Jaime: win, or Marcus loss and tiebreaker (up 20)
Marcus: win, or Jaime loss and tiebreaker (down 20)"
So I think my hypothesis for the Latino red shift is: 1) Latinos are socially conservative, 2) they don’t feel treated with dignity by the coastal elites - the latinx thing is a good example of this
So I win the 2000s baby bet
So I’m giving you 100x your admitted probability 
So I’m gonna use this opportunity to say #metoo
So I’m sure she’s thrilled with your “biggest bet of the season”
So idk how they decide who gets the free college or what, but their problems are certainly no smaller than that of the US
So if anyone wants to come on vacation with me somewhere cool, I’m trying to recruit. So far everybody is a butthead except possibly darrow 
So if Biden wins AZ NV MI WI and it’s a wrap
So if bosh was already on Miami vs agreeing to join with Lebron, then there's a huge difference apparently
So if I go to the Posa, it's all Darrow's fault
So if Kevin throws in darnold, is it fair?
So if the league vetoes everybody you nominate...
So if the Manager Skill table has Jordan: 10, Emyr: 2.5, and you join it to the Teams table using "Manager", you'll get Soy Sauce Oreo: 10, Golden Ticket: 2.5
So if they were edible, it would be funny?
So if we wanna do a FH hangout and/or Becker Bach party, it would need to be before then
So if you bought for any of those guys, you suck and are the reason John and Joe hate us
So if you control A, alt OCA, the whole page is auto fitted perfectly 
So if you want a DNR you need to carry a physical copy of it around at all times?
So I'm at training and 1) I got room 420 hehehe and 2) just met Pat Mitchell from our year
So I'm definitely not worried about them getting a fairer deal, considering they are the beneficiaries of the millions of dollars made by the football players
So I'm reading US IC believes Russia has the following dirt on trump: videos of trump banging prostitutes, business deals that were not-even-disguised bribes, and discussions during the campaign about "mutually beneficial" plans, possibly including the DNC hack 
So imagine if you saw this slide but it applied to BC
So IMO, that is where the real “privilege” lies
So in order for me to show, I'd prob have to take a train up Thursday and crash with one of y'all, then drive, then train back Sunday. Not impossible, just difficult...
So in that example, Collins ignored his assignment and designated himself a red dog shooting the A gap
So in the aggregate, leftys are "worse pitchers" than righties, but achieve the same results overall.  And the top lefties are better than the top righties. 538 estimates the "lefty advantage" is 0.6 runs against per 9 innings
So is anybody else down for music sharing or should I go fuck myself?
So is Jeb Bush, but his name is Bush so his electability is about zero
So is KD gonna be the new primary ball carrier and distributor on the Warriors? Equal split between him and steph?
So is long COVID real?
So is Pakistan
So is the boxing tourney happening Saturday after golf?
So is the new XFL same as the old XFL?
So is the wedding still on?
So it auto bids up to a certain value
So it turns out the vaccine does prevent infection. So the whole “it only prevents symptoms not necessarily infection/transmission” message was errant
so it was a $5 buy in, so lets have Nick Kevin John pay Goody. Marcus you pay me and I'll get the others.  Joe, you pay both of us since youre the only one capable of the fancy bizniss skoo maths
So it was a beef medium rareington 
So it was an empty threat? Smh not cool
So it’s an 8 Team college washups league
So it’s doubly risky if you lose money on the investment, and you also have to pay back what you borrowed 
So it’s literally bureaucratic reasons
So it’s the dodgers fault. Not surprised 
So it's Andrew Becker, true American hero and defender of all that is true and gold, vs a self proclaimed psychopathic murderer. It's your choice, GroupMe. Who do YOU vote for?
So it's just 100/1300 = 7.7%
So it's not worse, just in a different setting. Yeah I don't feel too bad.
So Joe you would buy now?
So Joe, can those things be improved? And if so, is whatever it takes to get him there better or worse than hiring again and going the BC hoops route?
So Joe, on the good side, torture allows you to potentially save thousands of innocent lives. On the bad side, it's arguably immoral and gives people who already want to kill innocents another reason to kill innocents. Not sure how the cons can possibly outweigh the pros, unless your aversion is for moral reasons. 
"So John goes on all these rona dates, and Kevin’s the one who catches it. 

God has a weird sense of humor"
So John that whole convo you screenshotted was just lame Becker?
So just think of her and the 6 JOs will be cake
So just to be clear though, were acquiescing the precedent that commissioner has competitive balance veto permissions
So like if I score badly one week and my opponent scores really high, I'd be very negative for that week?
So like sarcastic
So like when I take a shit I can grab my phone and try to get content  
So many contingencies...
So many great teams with great legacies and great fan bases, have been both historically good and recently good, digitally engaged market... just everything you can ask for in a sports region really
So maybe It is smart to sell now?
So much for that bus
So much going on here
So much greatness in that snapchat 
"So my lil bro Kevin goes to a school called Waldorf, it's real small and private, and their mission statement or whatever is that they are very uncensored and cultivate the whole person not just the brain etc. lots of weird kids, you get it...

Like 15 kids gave short speeches, and this one kid just tore into the school, saying there are the same cliques, same bullshit teachers with favorite students, etc. and sat down. Awkward. As. Fuck. "
So my list is all people I don’t know real well but had terrible interactions with
So my mouth and butthole are the same hole?
So naturally I agree. But Bernie has painted all wealthy people as “running pharmaceutical company and raising the price of insulin to the point that diabetics around the country are dying as a result“. Whereas in reality, the vast majority of that group are doctors, professionals, and normal people who are good at their jobs. And Bernie paints them all with the same brush. His entire brand is that of “down with capitalism, down with the wealthy”. There is no nuance to his stance. 
So need 6-10 minus 8 which is nursing 
So needless to say goodwin I strongly disagree with that take 
So no they’re not happy about the new pitch time but it’s not why they’re boycotting
So no trade restrictions whatsoever going forward?
So nobody is down for paintball besides joe and maybe Chan?
So not only does Emyr have the best team known to fantasy mankind, he also has $210 of budget
So Obama fucked the middle class to cover the poorest of the poor. Is that justice? Not for me to decide. But the whole "if you like your plan you can keep it", "it won't cost a dime", "the average family will see premiums reduce by $200 a year" lies that got the thing passed really piss me off. 
So Obamacare is toast right? I wonder what the future state is gonna look like. GOP will own the problem if they repeal it
So one person got it right
"So our situation is: 
1) Students who make it big
2) Students who are big benefits in college but won't make it big
3) students who benefit from 1 and 2"
So outside of top 40? 
So overhead and R&D. I get that. But still it seems fucking ridiculous... 
So Pats gotta be trying to trade for Cam right about now, right?
So people are commenting on that WHO report and the consensus seems to be what y’all already said: asymptomatic and presymptomatic are not the same, and the latter is still probably a huge spread risk. And they’re not pleased the WHO communication on this isn’t clear and leaves way too much room for interpretation for such a huge headline.
So people know going in to draft
So please address me as 379 Air Expeditionary Wing Senior Intelligence Officer
So poetic 
So politicians and PACs should disclose their balance sheets, and that's more or less good enough?
So related to my earlier question, I’ve been dating another LT here on base for the past month or so, and we leave in like 7 weeks. And it’s going really really well. So we either go our separate ways, or we have to get married. 
So sad
So Saturday Sept 2. Are we doing something fun for it?
So she definitely gets the hint
So she’s a big feminist right, but I guess she believes in “classical” feminism before the LGBTQ thing got all wrapped up in it. So people call her a TERF, and she’s been defending herself from that for a while, and generally it doesn’t end well 
So sick of the Yankees and they haven’t even won anything
So silent
So so close
So solid chance it accidentally slips into my vernacular forever
So sports fans, where does this guy "Bob Griffin" go from here?
So stantons contract looks good so far, barring injuries. Marlins arent close to a ship though, so is it worth it?
So taking any recommendations 
So technically every year besides the current one has a projected salary cap
So Ted Cruz...
So that rounds out the top 15
So that would be you selling Bell with a $10 call option on him
So that’s what my upper lip looks like 🤔
So that's why you took kickers out im assuming. And why you're a proponent of 2 QBs
So the answer is: designate a guy, he's the only one who can turn the light on. If it's your first time, turn it off; if not, leave it. The guy turns it on 100 times
So the answer to my question is no, you don't know if you're first?
So the bears were literally that last year lmao
"So the Becker position is:
1) mandate vaccines 
2) if you refuse, I hope you die
3) there’s too much death among the unvaccinated 
4) my favorite sport should continue uninhibited irrespective of #1-3"
So the Big 12 is finally gonna have 12 teams again?
So the bottom income tier of that population is already the upper class. Oversimplified but overall it’s true
So the CPs don't increase, but the max CP does? That would mean the CP bar would get less full as you level up, right? And is 20 the threshold for where max CP doesn't increase anymore?
So the first person tips off: red is odd # of red hats, blue is even # of red hats
So the Giants clearly believe in Jones
So the girl knows her age should be halfway between us
So the guy leaks it for revenge on the team, of which he is the announcer?? Can you imagine the irony of him saying "Wake needs to do XYZ to improve" on a broadcast?
So the line for acceptable wealth is “just slightly wealthier than Bernie” 
So the Malays are the Singapoor?
So the metaphor is perfect 
So the middle class is getting better, but the rich are getting richer too and that's not okay?
So the mountain could collapse on itself any moment?
So the Ners signed McKinnon for 30/4 and let Hyde walk to sign for 15/3. I don’t quite get that...
So the new company is going to effectively replace the PGA Tour
So the new Twitter tankie take is that the Cuban protestors are actually CIA agents who are posing as protestors to bring down the regime. Your boi is leaning into that / making fun of the protestors. 
So the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song was blasting during the postgame?
So the shit residue pools at the base of his balls
So the WR is running day from right to left, and the OT gets the ball running left to right
So there is inherent problem with insurance - hospital relationships that is completely independent of the healthcare coverage issue 
So there’s no rational argument that through 2 games, Cam hasn’t been much better than Brady, right?
So there’s no way that’s ordered right
So therein lies the question and topic of debate
So there's a matching logic to match med school grads to residencies in the most efficient way possible. Economists win again
So there's no option to re-pee, they'd retest with the same sample.  The only option is I ask the Accenture top folks on the account to ask the top AmEx folks for a waiver for me.  So I told my boss the sitch, he said he wants to keep me and tried to pitch it to the Accenture people.  They said it's not worth it to bother asking and make any noise.  Soooooo my last day is Friday �
So there's no way to tell if Emz or I would've picked him up in that 3 week (!) window
So they do exist
So they need to do something that looks big but not big enough to warrant further escalation. A large UAV swarm looks big, but if they all get intercepted or impact unimportant targets (like empty buildings or ranges) then it might not warrant escalation
So they should just let this buffoon ruin US foreign policy? Like “oh well, sucks for the entire world, but he is the president”
so they went from 3 to 6 and got a first, wizardry
So they're super motivated to have the player go one-and-done
So this is less consulting projects and more staff aug roles. And the main selling point is the price.
so this is the closest i could find to an "official decision" on survivor pool, that nothing was ever officially agreed upon, said by the man himself
So tldr, assuming no major upsets by Trump in MI, MN, WI, ME, NV... if Biden wins PA it’s probably over. If he loses, it’s gonna come down to ME and NE individual districts. 
"So very bold take here:
1) Toney
2) MVS
3) Rashee
4) Watson
5) Skyy"
So VIX it up baby?
So was Steve Wu, in a similar way
So watch out ladies
So we betting @#JustFacts✅ ? $20
So we can talk shit
"So we got:
Shape of you
Rockstar
*One hit wonder
One dance
Closer
Blinding lights
Sunflower 
*One hit wonder
*Not Havana but close
*Another Ed Sheeran son"
So we literally had zero performances to be proud of
So we still finna hang out Friday night or what?
so we're prob gonna need 2 groups
So what do I say "I feel like you're not doing anything and I'm doing everything?" just with more tact?
So what does "breaking up the banks" actually mean though?
So what happens after you catch one?
So what if she doesn’t testify then
So what I'm hearing is that the only minority team in the league is marked by a unique disadvantage, at the behest of the commissioner. #EndBostonCollegeRacism
So what was the trade?
So what’d would this run you like $200 bucks total?
So what’s the solution? I think that would literally kill college sports as we know it
So what's the exact path from here? I know it's been discussed before but I did not encode. You have 1-1.5 more years of mainly classroom stuff, then you choose your specialty sometime in year 3, then year 4 is mostly practicing. Then you get residency'd and do that for X years?
So what's the proposed time? Saturday at 9?
So what's your solution?
So when I say S&P, it goes to an index fund (vanguard, schwab, etc) that manages the fund. The funds performance, which is public, determines your return. The company takes an “expense ratio” as a fee, but for index funds it’s extremely low, like less than 0.2%
So when somebody does the power rankings of injury luck, Joe is going to be #1
So where is Franklin?
So while I disapprove of the actions, I even more disapprove of the calls for outrage that totally lack context
So who gets the #1 seed now
So who was the better pick: Mariota or Winston?
So why did they sign Jameis at all then?
So Williams and Amherst are 1 and 2 in Liberal Arts, not on the same list
So wouldn’t you want the biggest player by default then?
So Yankee / Cowboy / Laker fans are Hole Peeers. Glad I'm not one of them. 
So yeah goodwin pretty much hit the nail on the head
So yeah hegseth, broken clock
So yeah I guess I agree that in a "stable" situation, they matter. But since ~2010 they haven't because none of those tribal leaders or governments recognize them because it's pointless
So yeah the states that most expanded Medicaid funding under Obamacare have the most to lose
So yeah there you go Becker, maybe a bit editorialized, but that's Obamacare and why it will fail
So yeah this is really ironic
So yeah unlike most people, I'm praying that I didn't guess the right numbers 
So yes these girls got a friend request from Stephen Wu, while literally being in his profile picture 
"So yesterday we had an insane presentation from a retired TACP, who was at the Battle of Takur Ghar in Afghanistan. It’s one of the most famous battles in modern US history, 7 US SOF were killed, and 2 Medals of Honor were awarded. It was one of the most intense briefings I’ve ever had.

But get this: the presenter went too long, into our lunch time. The student commander got up and said if you wanna go to lunch you can. Like half the class got up and left, in the middle of a Purple Heart TACPs presentation, to go to fucking lunch. The head of the staff is livid, and just put everybody who left on Zero Privilege lockdown mode; and the student commander just got relieved of duty and might get kicked out. It’s some shit hahaha"
So you believe ACA was not enough, not in that it didn't do a good job offering coverage to the uninsured, but that it doesn't reduce costs (for the patient or provider) for the high frequency patient. That right?
So you can see how both Don and Bernie are labeled populists
So you can't say they aren't smart!
So you could say it lowers the steaks
So you couldn't sell anybody for less than keeper value. And if I sell him for more than I could've kept him for, I keep the difference
So you didn’t lose any distance but Chan did?
So you don’t buy that the Yankees are... for real?
So you don’t really like Wendy’s?
So you guys think the insurance companies are the main problem?
So you have diet AIDS?
So you have extra control over your fate
So you just have to cross your fingers that they didn’t just straight take your money
So you saw that’s a separate charge in addition to the sports betting charge, right?
"So you think he'd be half decent because:
1) He made a good real estate investment 50 years ago
2) We don't know what he actually thinks because his quotes so far are too crazy to be taken seriously.

Right?"
So you traded Murray, your "guaranteed top 10 RB" for ALEX SMITH and the opportunity to keep Keenan Allen with an aging QB for $17, when he'd probably be drafted for less. 
So you’d rejoin if we ban auction dollar trades?
So you’d take the 50% win, 25% OT over the 100% OT (which is say a 50/50 shot to win in of itself)
So you’re like the anti-vaxxer of hair care
So you’re taking the bills bet
So your boss has successfully captured the spirit of instagram
So your solutions are: do nothing, hope ACA stabilizes even though there's no evidence that it will. In the meantime, the average americans costs will continue to skyrocket. Yeah?
So you're gonna donate $750 million? 
So you're saying its a cost benefit analysis of value added vs. bad PR (as opposed to value added vs. bad character)
So, first one married gets the house?
So, have we decided who is replacing Jamie? And also how Emyr and I are going to equitably split keepers between our team and Goody's former team?
So, my hopes that were once optimistic about a principled Republican nominee have degraded into hopes that the actual Republican nominee gets vilified for months, starts going insane, gets divorced from his wife, and dies of a premature heart attack. 
So, so mysterious
So, the first one for him
"So, this where things stand by my understanding:
1) WNBA game is ""nice to have"". No punishment if skipped; pure honor system
2) SAT must be registered by [date TBD]. If not registered by then, replacement needs to be found. Chan is the only nominated replacement so far, and he has yet to accept/reject. 
3) @Idris Elba and I are going to split keepers across the Soy Sauce Oreo team and team that was formerly Goody's. Will be done by alternating draft. 

Any corrections/ modifications / objections?"
So, tldr: white people bickering ruined the team
So, who’s available for boda borg Saturday?
So, yes
So, yes?
So. Much. Sex. 
So. Now that it’s been brought up again. Is PV FV a rule or no
So... You wouldn't buy but you have no clue?
"So...
We're drafting at Beckers in Boston
Are we all in accord with WNBA being an acceptable Chan punishment?"
"So....
Pro waivers: Me, John
Pro FA: Goody, Darrow, Becks?

All pls chime in if you care"
So: Sunday evening (contingent on JJ). Can anyone not do that @Jamie Bourque @Skimmer
"so:

Soccer highest salaries though 😳
Soccer should do the same tbh

Some Army CC is giving his unit a motivational speech 
Some awesome Twitter data over the past 2.5 years:
"Some blue check on Twitter wrote a 
long story about his 9 y/o daughter wanting to open a can of beans, and instead of showing her how to use a can opener, he forced her to learn how to use it herself by analyzing it mechanically, which took 6 hours and lots of crying. People on Twitter have very strong opinions about his parenting style."
Some buildings are starting to have a transgender bathroom. The Accenture home office has one in the building. 
Some comprehensive charts on the rona that indicate the worst is in fact past us, barring a second wave
Some data on a previous discussion:
"Some end of deployment thoughts:
I’ll remember the AFG NEO for the rest of my life.
When shit gets real, I have faith that the bullshit will be cut through and the mission will be accomplished.
The Middle East will get worse as the US prioritizes china at the expense of CENTCOM. This sucks for the region but is probably the right move strategically. 
Pretty wild that the Iranian Houthi proxy has launched several ballistic missiles at major world cities twice in the past week and nobody bats an eye. US air defenses saved hundreds of lives. "
Some examples
Some examples^
Some folks are talking about how the allegations against Kavanaugh are uniting the right more than ever before in the Don presidency. It’s the only environment where the trumpsters applaud flake, graham, et al. Interesting take.

Some incredible EHoovs level stories today and I need the ASMB take
Some incredible repercussion possibilities for the city of Philadelphia, and therefore the state of Pennsylvania, the nation, and the entire world 
Some interesting world affairs that the US officially acknowledged yesterday. It’s far from impossible that Libya becomes another Syria. And it’s a reminder that when the US isn’t the world police, it means somebody worse is. 
Some might say I have been excluded from the friend zone
Some might say it’s the Barry Bonds of pizzas
Some more US joint force deployments just announced. Depends what you consider “major”
Some of my favorite HS memories were coming home from school, popping in Halo 3, putting on my headset… and getting called gay
Some of my favorite underlying Steven Wu context is that a lot of girls thought he was super attractive freshmen year on Newton, and he proceeded to piss it all away with his personality
Some of the dubs owners wanted to trade Barnes and Klay for Love in 2013. Thank heavens the majority said no. 
Some of the keeper values are wrong 
Some of the most incredible finishes of the season all today
some of the words have legit usage, others are completely devoid of meaning
Some of them I'd like to
Some of those WRs could’ve been great picks if they weren’t auto’d by KevinBot smh
Some people are saying he wishes he signed with the giants
Some people are saying rapidash and arcanine would be better RBs
Some people get drone struck instead
Some people have anime girls as their avatar, some people have Dr LT Kelleher. Whatever turns them on. 
Some positive news
Some serious shit is going down in Istanbul...
Some would say Tannehill / Love / Howell etc could be good but I don’t think any team rolls them out week 1 and considers it a success
Somebody add Steve buscemi 
Somebody ask Erin Hoover her opinion on the matter
Somebody better lock this madman up before he brings down the city!

Somebody wanna Tldr this for me?
Somebody who is very legal and very cool
Somebody will do it. But if there’s a strong candidate who has multiple options, broncos are probably not the top of the list 
Somehow I’m not broken up about it and I doubt Georgia fans are either
Somehow plane crashes were brought up twice today in completely separate contexts
Somehow that makes me feel better
Somehow the Giants are the only redeemable NFC East team and their front office is garbage and their fans are not bottom of the power rankings 
Somehow the third most dislikable dodger 
Somehow they’ve become a scrappy exciting underdog with low probability of immediate success but potential to exceed expectations 
Somehow your take got even worse
Somehow… I’m ok with that…
Someone go in search me and see what I said I’d offer Herb like 6 months ago
Someone needs to make an itinersry
Someone on twitter/reddit/IG was saying it’s a shame we didn’t have pitch tracking data back then, because we’re unable to see how many actually hittable pitches Barry got in any given season
Someone please call her a fascist for saying that
Someone should’ve brought this up when the trade was made
Someone told me Kayla Quinn is gonna be on the next bachelor
"Someone: Omg I love chipotle

Becker: Wow like honestly who cares? Everybody likes chipotle you’re not special 

John: Chipotle is garbage. They don’t even use authentic frijoles. You need to try real Mexican food"
Something about a lake that is near Niagara Falls
Something about an S curve?
Something about Capitol Hill iirc 
Something about second half big plays?
Something about storming the field in a pandemic...
Something I don’t understand: Gun ownership rates haven’t changed and long rifles have been owned for decades, and yet the mass shooting surge has only just happened. It’s clearly not JUST a guns issue.  
Something like “if you claim single digits and you shoot above 90, you instantly must add 2 strokes to your handy you lying fuck”
Something like that
Something like that is the only reason I could think of
Something like top 10 WR and top 30 CB
Something like, if it's your first time, turn the light off...
Something tells me wokeism is toxic 🤔 
Something the Sox apparently couldn't do
Something TSwift, Ed Sheeran, Drake, Adele, Katy Perry. So yeah I’d agree that guys list is pretty good. 
Sometime in April 
Sometime in the dead of winter, preferably in a snowstorm
Sometime this fall we should do a BC football game + HR Derby
Sometimes I forget that we are 14 year olds in the bodies of grown men, but times like now always bring me back to the sad reality
Sometimes I got annoyed by how much the Pats fans at BC worshipped Tom Brady but then I remember Barry Bonds
Sometimes I think "former Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco" is included solely for the troll effect
Sometimes I think I could beat all the other fuckholes combined in a round
Sometimes I think I should just set the cap at 25. Tops. 
Sometimes I think these left wing nut jobs are false flags by the republicans to make people hate the Dems 
Sometimes I’m in awe at the deep insight journalists provide
Sometimes if you switch the flight attendants will hook you up with a free meal, if they’re aware you switched 
Sometimes I'm afraid I caused Gordon Callenders disappearance because I was the last question he answered on askfm
Sometimes it’s hard to remember it’s a tie game when you’re caught in the heat of waiting for a free throw to be shot
Sometimes one just finds himself deeply in love with the coco
Sometimes when Marcus claims to ask an honest question, I feel like it is not actually an honest question
Sometimes you can't tell if it's gonna be a wet one or worse, and the alcohol gives you overconfidence 
Sometimes you gotta put people in the back of the office where they belong
Sometimes your post is so good you gotta give yourself a heart
Somewhat funny observation + laughing minion = terrible meme sure to be shared by aunts on Facebook
Somewhat similar to Jeb Bush and Kamala in 2019, or Hillary every time since 2008
Somewhere between a marginal factor and the only factor 
Somewhere between Paul Crew and a statutory rapist. Dr LT is not held in high esteem by Dr Becker
Somewhere, you mean some-when like when the dinosaurs were still roaming the earth 
Song of Summer that’s it
Songs I thought were on that album weren’t
Sonic is trash
Sooo I guess DeAndre Ayton isn’t turning it to be a worthwhile investment
Soooo do we still root for the Falcons?
Soooo if the browns are good, do we have to rename marika?
Soooo you're saying Brady is racist and hates immigrants.
Sooooo they ran the play action?
Soph year we would go to Moogys on thursdays and it got bigger and bigger and then moogys called in undercovers. So me and 5 others got ID busted. 
Sophomore girl admirer
Sophomore year at BC, I told Stephen Wu that he needs to remove his fb prof pic with 3 girls who had no idea who he was
Sophomore year first semester. Started talking about how he's gonna make the football team and completely change everything with his skills. Said he'd be starting QB instantly, be a heisman candidate, etc. Pissed off a lot of actual football players. Around the same time he ran for BC Senate and was hounding everybody nonstop to vote for him. 
Sophomore year Halloween, we're all tearing up Walsh and Stephen Wu somehow shows up and enters. I don't actually remember him being there but he certainly was. He ends up taking a picture with Jenna LaConte Jessie Carbone and Jillian Timko, they're all pretty good looking chicks and I guess he realizes as much. Fast forward to next morning, and Jenna texts me telling me she got a fb friend request from Steve Wu... and his profile picture is the pic he took with them last night. She has zero recollection of taking the photo and is naturally pretty weirded out that she's IN his PROFILE photo.

Sorta like the first 4 games are like another preseason. Does anybody else feel me or am I crazy?
Sorta like the mock weddingV
Sorta like twisted teas
Sorta reminds me of the UFC fight Rory McDonald bs Robbie Lawler II. One of the greatest fights of all time, both guys took hellish levels of damage. In the final round with ~2 minutes to go, Lawler hit McDonald with a clean jab. And after eating haymakers for 20 minutes, it was the little jab that broke Rory, and he buckled, and quit. Point is luck has been through so much over 6 years, he’s come to a point where he’s broken mentally. I’m not gonna knock McDonald for quitting to a jab, and I’m not gonna knock Luck for quitting to a foot injury.
Sorta same reason i hate Dwight Howard. Supposed to be the team leader, appears to not care to us fans, revealed that he doesn't care to his teammates either, says fuck you I'm a champion anyway, becomes a pariah. 
Sorta similar then. I was thinking back to wrestling workouts when we'd do "sprint the sides, walk the turns" alternating 100s on a track. Aka the puke-a-thon
Sorta. Tee box on 3 and 4 are under repair, so they're a 120 yd and 60 yd temps, respectively. Bunkers on 7 are being redone. And normal spotty grass with winter and all. But other than that, good shape. Good greens especially. 
Sorta? Like I don't wanna do this forever but I don't hate it and I'd be ok here for another 2-3 years if I needed to be?

Suppose well agree to disagree then. I can’t see how progressives disliked a moderate democrat to the point where they’d be fine with fucking Trump winning, unless said candidate was uniquely bad. This is further supported by moderate democrats winning midterm elections in trump-won areas, since the non-voting progressives clearly aren’t making a difference there
Suppose you could just not have borders at all and go back to ancient Greek style city-states, and let the villages in between basically hang out to dry if somebody comes with guns
Suppose you gotta put the big fundamental up there honestly
Supposed to be 3 months salary right?
Supposed to be one of the first "unicorns", then couldn't do anything he was supposed to be amazing at
Supposedly an amazing empire. Then of a sudden it one day basically exploded, literally exploded like a volcano. Nobody really knows why or how. 
Supposedly he was to be used in relief
Supposedly that's supposed to change this year
Supposedly the ability to not renew contracts and not pay all the benefits makes consultants better than hiring much of the time 
Supposedly they got it right
Sure
Sure
Sure
Sure am glad Marcus didn’t take my cowboys over 10 wager
Sure as fuck wasn’t 2024
Sure as long as it’s cheap-ish, I’m all ears 
Sure but if they lose millions in season 1 he sure as hell isnt gonna keep it going 
Sure feels like #TwoCidersJoe has been present a lot this past month
Sure fucking hope so man. I just shudder of the international consequences
Sure goody but it’s at the expense of literally killing poor people. Don’t feel so good now do ya
Sure hope he can fly an F-18 because the F-14s are retired 
Sure hope he sold before the war lol
Sure I say yeah somebody will. 100 years is a long ass time 
Sure I'll be waiting for you in New York
Sure it’s a 0.001 vs 0.002 percent chance of a female Tim Wakefield vs a female PJ Tucker
Sure seems like a lot of NFL owners are bad people
Sure send it my way
Sure they can do steak with spices same as everyone else, but "authentic" Spanish food? Now I know why it's only paella popular outside of Spain
Sure was nice of the oil companies to all decide to get less greedy all of a sudden
Sure why not
Sure would’ve liked to guess without having it spoiled
Sure, when?
Sure. Book it
Sure. Oddsshark has 7.5
Sure. We can dodge sniper fire on the runway 
Surely
Surely Marcus cannot be alone in being such a superficial hater
Surely the hype as a best picture candidate played into it, but when I watched it I was like what in Poseidon’s name is this fishfucking bullpoo 
Surely you made a ton of money betting on Washington then
Surely you’d agree it’s an effective rhetorical tactic 
SURELY! Dude gets all the goal line carries!!
Surfin Bird on repeat
Surprised Bud Light didn’t sponsor the Transperfect Music City Bowl between Auburn and Maryland
Surprised he hasn’t tweeted “BIG TEN! VOTE!” yet
Surprised Michigan offense has sputtered so bad after the first quarter
Surprised she wasn’t swayed by “suburban women, can you please like me?”
Surprised Tankie Boi isn’t screeching about it on IG
Surprised the falcons defense haven’t switched tactics to force Foles to beat them deep
Surprising #1 defense in the league coupled with zero offense? Sounds like a certain college football team
Surprisingly low: 26
Surrounded by haters
Surrounded by haters once again
Surrounded by haters yet again
Survivor pool is pick a team to win each week, can't use the same team twice, when you lose you're out. Right?

Syria is such a clusterfuck though. I think we should basically arm the YPG and otherwise stay out of it, while also saying loudly and often "hey remember Iraq nobody wants that shit again". Afghanistan should get more focus. ISIS is ironically not as much of a problem anymore, but yeah they can continue to get bombed
Syria situation is insane
T shirt and shorts works. If you’re a huge pussy you’ll wear a long sleeve shirt and long pants because it makes it hurt less but it’s really not bad at all

Take it back
Take it easy. Not all of us can be athletes like you Jeff
Take of two halves
Take on oil from a reliable source: Futures contract expires tomorrow so it is more a Wow headline than end of oil usage.  The next months’ contracts trade at like 22 and 26 per barrel. Still a bad economic signal. In addition to demand issues because of virus oil has its own problems like oversupply and politics.
Take one of your golf courses and start the Becker Invitational. 
Take Steve Wu for example. I do not ever wanna hang out with that kid, but I don't hate him and he's never wronged me. People like Lexi Schaeffer are the people I hate (great immediate snipe btw goody)
Take that back he's not long at all
Take the 50-50 as a loss and let yourself “train”
Take the day off. I'll do it too.

Taliban is a more political (but still very much ultra Islamic) group originally formed to fight soviet occupation in the 80s, mission is much more localized aka taking over Afghanistan and acting as a political group. ISIS formed from a branch of al qaeda in the mid late 2000s and is much more hardline Islamic and brutally violent, with a mission that involves more terrorism against the “far enemy” aka attacks on the west
Talk about momentum killers

Tangent to the CFP expansion is the fact that the P5 is heading toward a P3 + 2, which will further exacerbate the parity problem 
Tangent, but I still can't fucking believe I'm already eliminated from the playoffs with second most points scored
Tangent, but I’m so excited for Space Force starring steve carrell 
Tangent, I didn’t watch the animated tv series’ but apparently they were incredible. Anybody watch them?
Tangential to this: I've been convinced that Ty Cobb's famously being a huge racist and asshole is a lie, and he actually wasn't a bad dude
Tangentially related and interesting
Tangentially relevant, quote from Gregg Popovich yesterday:
Tankie refers to communist regimes’ tendency to roll in the tanks against their protestors, like in Tiananmen Square
Tankies in shambles

Tatum and Brown had otherworldly seasons last year, and everyone assumed they were guaranteed to improve when they’ve regressed, which shouldn’t be surprising. 
Tatum Brown and picks, and then use that to entice Lebron 
Tavon Austin is good only when he gets room to run, which is only when he does end arounds. Dude cannot create space
Taylor asked me to go there. I’m trying to get him to reconsider
Taylor doing great PR for her because everybody hated her before

Taylor Swift insta sells out her cardigans but I cannot imagine ever wanting to buy a Ryan Gosling jacket or whatever
Taylor Swift is also very good. Different Taylor, but good taylor
Taysom Hill o/u 3.5 rushing TDs
TBD. I asked to put myself on a shortlist of ready to go when called. They said it could be anywhere from June to December
Tbh agree with the pick
Tbh I cannot get enough takes on this. Fire away @#Just📠✅ 
Tbh I don’t think I’ve ever eaten at a restaurant before the game. But I’ve drank at momos, 21st amendment, and the lagunitas pop up bar just south of the bridge 
Tbh I expected a plastic surgeon to have better breasts
Tbh I haven’t fully processed it yet. Not sure I ever will
Tbh I just thought the pic was hysterical 
Tbh I think about this one more
Tbh i think i vary in this
Tbh I think paintball in the PM, then regroup and go out at night is the best plan for Saturday 
Tbh I think the shoulder shrug by the players about kyrie makes the agents (and other players) not care as much
Tbh I was always more of a Starcraft guy... but LoL is kinda cool actually
Tbh I’d be totally down with just picking up food and Ubering over
Tbh I’d rather have a Doc Bock than a Doc who allegedly is super plugged in but thinks NATO forced Putin to invade Ukraine
Tbh I’ve been more pointing to his immediate success and saying “this is why Jimmy G isn’t good”
Tbh I'm not a big fan. Suffragette City and Heroes are like the only songs I enjoy.
Tbh it was hysterical seeing her Facebook personality after meeting her for like 2 days
Tbh my reaction was “hmm I thought he said this already”
Tbh not sure I have one. It’s just teams (ie the dodgers and the chiefs)
Tbh that’s exactly what I want in my doctors
Tbh the pats should probably pivot to that strategy right now
Tbh this whole conversation is disgusting
Tbh we are lucky to be included in that group 
Tbt to bonesaw 
Tbt to early 2022 when Faiz was reposting this dude supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine
Tbt to when I was calling Meyer a disaster in week 2 and goody said it’s impossible to follow the NFL drama from (ironically) Qatar
Tbt to when the FH were considering planning a trip around this game lmao
Team 2 is better, I think if I'm them I make the trade
Team decided to be prime Barry bonds during the semis smh
Team games are fun because sometimes you’ll be losing a fight but then a teammate comes and saves you in like Gandalf and the Rohirim saving Gondor

Technically no. Just passing the PT test is
Technically one but 2 makes more sense I suppose. The top hole and the bottom hole
Technically USC has zero wins in 2004 and 2005
Technically yes. Tough to get your hands on though 
Ted Cruz released his end of campaign message:

Terrible call
Terrible call. How do you make that call
Terrorism is getting worse and worse since the US curtailed military activity in the Middle East (could be noise but I think it's more than that). And America / the world already decided that invading the Middle East is not a good idea.

Texans are a joke franchise both by not trading up for Bryce when they could have, and not trading down if they truly were Bryce or bust 
Texans hire a black guy and not Josh McCown. Successful play action 
Texans in full “ok we hired a black guy first, can we hire Josh McCown now?” mode
Texans is a trash name 
Texans look sad
Texans receiver didn’t kneel after fielding a the kickoff in the end zone, tossed ball to ref, recovered by bills and ruled a TD for 5 seconds
Texans reportedly between McCown and Flores. Either choice is gonna be a shocking development and I love it
Texas Bama insane rn
Texas is basically 50-50, and not winner take all. Biden has drastically exceeded expectations, thanks to the wisdom of Pete and Amy, the two best candidates in the field
Texas is putting 65+ and higher risk people ahead of “essential workers” in its 1b phase. Which is a break from what the CDC is recommending
Texas Oklahoma 👀

Textin from the plane lets do trivia!
Tfw this messaging just lost 2 GA senate races, giving the democrats the trifecta, but you have political 💎🙌🏼 and are determined to bring the ship down with you
Tfw you claim to be a 6 and get outplayed by Charles Barkley 
Tfw you just declared a national emergency but you gotta hit that breakfast buffet because the eggs Benedict slap too hard
Tfw you lose the presidency and both houses in a single term and it’s all your fault
Tfw you probably shouldn’t have called them latinxes
Tfw you’re a Republican congressman who just dusted off the fiscal responsibility argument 
TFW you’re surprised “don’t knock pegging til you try it” doesn’t go over great
Tfw your trump ad uses MiG-29s and not American aircraft. Big yikes

Thank god Mattis is SecDef and Don is terrified of him 
Thank god no, just herb (street not ert) deep throating that unagi on broadcast
Thank god we have Jayhawk Jamie to prove that it did once exist, and it was hysterical 
Thank god we have the republicans looking out for the little guy
Thank heavens the Giants and Warriors both won or I might've back flipped off the Brooklyn bridge 
Thank Jameis, my inspiration
Thank ye thank ye

Thank you, Dr Becker, for your groundbreaking thesis on when cancel culture is acceptable 
Thankfully dare dorm is one of them 
Thankfully the broncos have a great track record of that
Thanks
Thanks @DesignHoles
Thanks @Hongy T for planning it. Such a great planner 
Thanks @Marcus Bauer it was a pleasure betting with you. And shoutout to 538 for making marcus overconfident by magnitudes 
Thanks @Professor Of Asstronomy for asking about me. Should be out of the med clinic tomorrow
Thanks and all but you are so not Iroh jfc
Thanks babe
Thanks bcsuperfan22

Thanks but about to go back in so go back to sleep
Thanks but I don’t venture too far out of the mainstream. I rarely if ever show somebody an indie band
Thanks chan
Thanks Chan 
Thanks chan for dropping out and allowing me and Emz to join the league. It's been an absolute blast
Thanks commissioner
Thanks cool guy
Thanks darrow 
Thanks darrow. Counters 1) the Bell and OBJ keepers have fucked everyone else over for years but nobody's done anything about that. 2) so you're agreeing that there is an arbitrary present value vs future value limit that can be enforced at will?
Thanks dude 
Thanks dudes I'll have to check those out
Thanks ESPN. Critical analysis as always
Thanks for birthday wishes friends
Thanks for calling me out on that retarded what if scenario
Thanks for doing the tough jobs that make the world a better place. Doctors are heroes!
Thanks for giving me an extra ~1.5% odds btw
Thanks for hosting and buying food joe
Thanks for the input yesterday Joe

Thanks goodwin. I just finished yalls
Thanks guys
Thanks guys I’ve been lifting 
Thanks guys. It just means I go to San Angelo Texas (dead center of the State, middle of nowhere) for 9 months of Intel school, then I get assigned to a duty station or deploy 
Thanks haha I can never tell because I rarely get a serious response
Thanks Jamie. I was very confused for a minute haha
Thanks Jeff 
Thanks Jeff 
Thanks Jeff 
Thanks Jeff 
Thanks Jeff 
Thanks Jeff 
Thanks Jeff no biggie tho I can take it
Thanks Jeff. About time I got some recognition instead of ridicule from the haters for never striking out in little league 
Thanks Jeff. Suicide risk below average today thanks to you. 
Thanks Joe
Thanks joe 
Thanks joe 
Thanks Joe and Darrow, and even thanks to the haters and losers 🇺🇸 
Thanks Joe and Goodwin

Thanks Marcus 
Thanks Marcus 
Thanks SportsCenter
Thanks this is a long time coming. Finally on track to do something I’m interested in instead of slaving for the big business machine
Thanks tho. Tried the podcast thing, wasn't too into it
Thanks to NBCLX, I am 100% convinced that being bad at wordle means you’re dumb
Thanks to troop lover Joe and the rest of the hotel 
Thanks, female body inspector agent 69
Thanks. David right?
Thanks. God that’s creepy
Thanks. I’m just gonna get the most basic coverage
Thanks. I'd prefer the pool and re-pick method for splitting keepers, but your way is easier and if nobody objects I'm cool with it too.
Thanks. I'm not going to make a rash decision, but I don't want to wait forever to make an overly informed situation
Thanks. In Atlanta right?
Thanks. Sorry sort of a  boomer 
Thanks. They are truly everywhere
Thar ya go 'Arry
That 2pt conversion play was awesome
That 4th down heave to DK was awful coverage. DB looked like he was going for the landing spot of the ball instead of actually covering the WR 
That actually might be a 14 point swing because Lawrence is out 
That aligns with what I’ve read
That and the Kawhi Leonard conf finals shot might be 1 and 2
That and the Texas vs Texas tech game in 2008 are the two best college football games I've ever seen 
That Anesto snapchat damnnnn hahaha
That angel large Spanish dude 
That angry bird's face is a perfect image of how I feel most of the time
That arms been dead for 2 years 
That article is amazing hahahahaha 
That article is clearly sarcastic btw
That article preview 😂😂😂😂😂
That article seems just meant to rouse rabble and not be an actual opinion 
That as*
That ASJ fumble call is terrible
That assumes the base is gonna jump ship and vote republican otherwise? 
That ball was hit 150 mph
That bar is an absurd place
That bear has a better outside single than I do
That Becker pic is amazing every time 
That being said I love me some JJ Kirk stacks 
That being said, I remind myself daily that the United States, for all its flaws, is the best place to live in the history of the known universe, especially if you are gay, poor, or a racial or religious minority
That being said, I think the demand for computer skilled jobs is so extremely high that students can basically guarantee they can get a high paying job if they study that field.
That being said, mega yikes
That being said, there is a loyal fan base that generally guarantees a minimum of ~200k buys no matter who is on the card
That blows for the Giants. Played awesome defense all half then 2 TDs on an unreal scramble and a hail Mary 
That breaks even (not counting opportunity cost of other cards) with $22500 in annual spending, just counting the 2%. I don't think that's worth it for me
That bunny seems soft but it gets hard really fast
That call was horseshit
That Canes sauce is frickin amazing tho
that caption makes no sense with the picture
That chart sucks
That CHI IND Super Bowl is so memorable. Hester KR TD first play, bears barely get a first down the rest of the game
That chick in the top right looks super excited for you
That clapping argument style triggers me 
That clown is no match for new MVP candidate Kelly Olynyk
That could work out actually. Do you know her timeframe? She's welcome to come see my place 
That could’ve been a double play
That cut is nasty wow
That data is absolutely false
That Dave Roberts reaction should be a hall of fame gif
That decision to go for it on 4th instead of the FG might be big 
That defense absolutely crumbled man they were so good in 2016
That depends on the type of poop. Like if it’s a first of the day post-coffee poop, it’s like 30 mins. It can be up to like 3 hours tho
That does sound like collusion 
That doesn’t address the point
That doesn’t count
That doesn’t make any sense
That doesn’t make any sense to me
That doesn’t surprise me at all
That doesn't even make any sense!
That doesn't make sense. If he keeps kamara for $10, then he'd have to pay you an additional $5 to keep him. You don't just get $5 out of thin air
That doesn't make sense... Attack power, effectiveness, and opponent HP are factors but that shouldn't trump CP
That doesn't sound endearing or amusing
That Don gif is gold
That Don makes it one term
That Don tweet might actually be the all time worst hill to die on
That drive mahomes was finally getting time until the red zone
That droplet of liquid on the court that caused O’Neal to slip 6 inches literally saved that guys life 
That entire bit is a modern classic
That explains the 30/49 skipped questions...
That fan gonna get murdered
That fat SJW bitch must be hanging out there today
That feels fake
That feels wayyy too low
That first inning was 🔥 
That first one about the Orlando victims blindsided me
That first play of this game reminded me of the Broncos-Seahawks super bowl
That fucking guy is bottom 2 in the fantasy analyst power rankings 
That fucking penalty was horse shit
That game is awesome and also takes crazy practice. Tried playing at my friends and called it a success every time I hit the ball lmao 
That game taught me that magnets attract apples
That game was fun as shit. It was a Humongous Entertainment game. Same people as backyard baseball
That game was just unbelievable 
That geico commerical was hilarious
That gif is hilarious hahahaha
That gif is worse than AI broke Antonio Daniels ankles twice in one play
That gif shows the tumblers locked, then a key goes in and lines them all up and unlocks the door
That gif will never be more perfect 
That girl is definitely not anything close to a 🐐
That girl is like 19. You guys are disgusting
That girl was smoking hot but such a bitch
That goes for the lot of you
That guy (x10) was on my gordo softball team 
That guy actually kinda looks like you goody
That guy is definitely not the first guy in and last guy out
That guy smh...
That guys face has too many angles
That haircut is called “The March Madness”
That happened with the entire Air Force recently. After several hundred messages, Some LT Col replied all saying you can unsubscribe by taking your computer to the top floor of your building and throwing it out the window
That happened???
That happens after the fact 
That has to be it. Jets and Commies aren’t taking WR
That has to be satire
That has/will surely be a jeopardy question
That he doesn’t 
That Hillary gif is painful
That I agree with and the fact he opens a goat door, missing the rest of your reasoning
That immediate trade back is collusion
That inch makes a huge difference
That incident aloneraised the adversity score by at least 5 points
That is a bonkers contract
That is a classic Chan 
That is a fake fucking name
That is a LOT of capital
That is a mega yikes from a guy who is a high stakes gambler 
That is a plausible argument
That is a punchable face
That is a rollercoaster of emotions for that Pitt kicker lmao
That is a sad sad man
That is a stacked card 
That is a totally legitimate argument
That is a trademark #TeamKelleher joke
That is a very well documented falsehood
That is a 🔥take
That is almost the perfect finger guns bitmoji
That is amazing
That is an A+ gif
That is an amazing deal for the Sox
That is close wow
That is correct
That is correct!
That is far too long a timeline to forecast
That is fishy, but No move involving Brock LOLsweiler can reasonably be considered collusion 
That is freaky looking
That is fucking hilarious 
That is literal torture
That is literally the mindset that cost hillary the election lmao
That is my excuse^
That is not a flattering picture or Rey
That is not an accurate description of the incredible policy framework that is the Kelleher Plan
That is one happy cat
That is one of the best homers I've ever seen
That is one of the loser-est things I’ve ever written 
That is probably the worst drink of all time
that is so frickin false
That is spicy 
That is the best joke you’ve ever told
That is the definition of a better conference though
That is the only situation in which a trade should be vetoed
That isn’t the point of the article tho. It’s that California’s talk is all super progressive, but their actions are repeated mega failures
That jack McGuire butthole is a ripoff of McCock
That kid has a super punchable face 
That last drive looked good. Let’s keep it up
That last interception should’ve been -6 points
That last one is both ageist AND sexist 
That last one is the worst news for niantic. Means they're not gonna grow anymore, now is basically is as big as the user base gets
That last one is too true
That last pick was so bad. Possibly cost them the game
That last point is certainly true 
That late 90s braves team was so stacked. Hard to believe they never won after 95
That laughing goose gif is too 5 in the all time gifs power rankings
That literally is a totally different conversation... 
That little spoon bubbler that I used to smoke in Vandy is better than a gas mask. No joke. 
that looks like a pulled hammy
That looks professional
That looooong Obama Doctrine article from The Atlantic is a very comprehensive criticism as well, though it takes a much more nuanced approach in doing so 
That makes sense but it means nothing for me if only client gets it, since nobody in my own company would know
That makes sense hahaha
That makes slightly more sense. Still seems unbelievably low to me
That man looks like he loves to kiss titties
That may be true, but note that the disease is "having a micropenis" and being a grammar nazi is only a symptom. Likewise, sneezing is a symptom of having a cold, but just because one sneezes does not mean he or she has a cold. Therefore, it is very plausible that one can correct grammar without having a micropenis. #knowledgedropped
That maz post is the most poor me and my first world problems shit I ever heard
That mcgregor guillotine was so silly
That means they gave her about a 7.7% chance to beat Serena. Damn. 
That meme is way too much effort 
That might actually not be a bad idea lol
That might be right idk
That might be the last video game I played regularly 
That might be true in GM. GSL champions from the last 2.5 years shows that Protoss is pretty underpowered haha
That movie Avatar
That must be an exhausting way to live
That must be why they always say you can’t record games without the express written consent of the CBA
That NBC special on mahomes astrology sign was the most puke worthy thing I’ve ever seen. Disgusting attempt to win over white women who are watching for Taylor Swift. Fuck you NBC
That non PI Kittle PI call ends up being huge 
That number was given as the “injury guarantee”. I’m sure he has a ton of easy triggers like “make the opening day roster”
That of course doesn’t mean that all BC students are privileged, but i guess my point is that the cross section of BC students we are looking at is “extremely successful students”
That offsides no call was such horseshit tho
That one dude was so salty though. Literally in the middle of his thank you speech, he's like "and we lost by the way..."
That one fold is a world of difference
That one I knew
That only applied to men
That only costs $5MM a year! 
That part above the collar looks kinda fucked up you should return it
That part is (probably) not true but her name is actually Antonia
That person was you until last week when you were a cocksucker
That physician probably tells people that Q Tips aren’t for cleaning ears
That PI call was total bull
That picture perfectly encapsulates your personalities
That play action screen was the first creative play call by McVay all damn game 
That play was for San Mateo
That post gotta be tongue in cheek
That practicing was against the rules  
That probably seals my bet against joe 
That reads like an actual parody lmao
That real long article from the Atlantic discussed it in great detail
That retro Miller lite commercial was awesome
That right center wall. Where home runs go to die
That right there just shows how fucking useless the UN is
That RT been getting crushed
That run was all stidham 
That said I do totally relate to Collin here
That said I wouldn’t be surprised if Rodgers is never good again. Achilles injuries are brutal and he’s 40
That said, as someone who regularly reads the site, I disagree that all of 538 is a bad forward looking site
That said, I support the decision to beat Marcus at all costs
That same week, he got into fights in Mac and the Plex, I think a knife was pulled in one of them. Got suspended after that. And that's when he posted his epic Facebook rant
That screenshot been going around lol it’s not Chan 
That second one is a scorching hot take
That second stat isn't true but it would be funny tho
That seems intentionally absurd to drive engagement. If so, we’ll done chiefs social media 
That seems like a Fun Power Rankings to me
That seems plausible. Where'd you read that?
That seems to be the most likely course of action right now despite everything 
That ship has sailed. More like Joey Office Hours now
That shit was expensive as fuck. Goody you must've spent like legit $500+ on salvia during that time
That should except me from this bandwagon nonsense that Emyr somehow started
That slow mo looked really bad
That snapchat should win an Oscar 
That so many millennials are so susceptible to populist demagoguery is shameful
That sounds fun as hell
That sounds great. What credit card company?
That sounds like a great name for a porno
That sounds like a lot of work 
That sounds like an article title from the Federalist
That sounds not like Tiger tbh
That sounds pretty much ideal
That sounds right to me?
That sounds terrible
That stat about having 10 (now 11) TD drives starting inside their own 10 is nuts
That stat doesn't make a ton of sense to me, too many externalities. Like how much do you value a future Duke player who is currently in high school? How do you value Coach K as a coach and as a recruiter, or the school brand  as a recruiting tool. Would ticket sales and merchandise be the same with a better or worse team, and by how much? 
That story is insane and I hate to rain on the parade but color me extremely skeptical 
That stuff happens every play
That sucked compared to yesterday 
That sucks becker 
That sucks but at this point the teams have to realize it’s gonna be unfair, and it’s gonna be randomly unfair. Because it’s either unfair or cancelled
That sucks so much 
That surely will never come up again 
That swing tho 👀 
That taser video was so satisfying to watch hahahaha
That the baseballs were altered somehow this year to make them be hit harder
that they're willing to do big favors for their star players that are not in team interests
That thing is pretty cool. Would love if this league had a contest with that
That thing looks pretty cool. Small ass shotgun though
That thing that looks like her bicep is actually her tricep
That ties my best ever. I lost on The Bell Jar
That time I visited Boston in like 2015 and y’all and emyr and Pat’s crew all came to Black Rose is among my favorite post-grad memories 
That top 5 order looks good tho
That true?
that vaunted 2018 draft class has Lamar jackson, josh Allen who is what Lamar haters said he was, Baker the so far flash in the pan, darnold the ghost seer, and josh Rosen 
That video made at least 11 people happy, and max 1 possibly 2 people unhappy. That is a net benefit to society SIR
That Vikings ram commercial was hilarious hahahaha
That WAR7 number is pretty low considering his career WAR
That was (eventually) wildly entertaining. Kudos to Jamie, Joe and Chan
That was 9 yards under thrown on a 15 yard pass
That was a good guess
That was a good one
That was a great ESPN commercial 
That was a great night 
That was a great QB play
That was a perfect throw tho. Actually great coverage but just perfect placement by Rodgers 
That was a real #tbt to AIM bots
That was a really good post goody
That was a softball shit how did I miss that one
That was a throwback to the Addazio days
That was a weird play call
That was a whole TV episode
That was actually a great throw but QJ plays the smallest for big WR in the league. And just a great play by stingley 
That was also when pre-Marika Katelynn would hang out all the time and be way cooler than post-Marika 
That was always a top tier photoshop 
That was amazing
That was an awesome post. Go Conor do your thing. 
That was an impressive drive tho ngl 
That was an insane pass
That was an open corner three I don't hate it
That was around October 2014, and he lied dormant for what seemed like years... watching, listening, waiting for he right time to rise again and display his greatness to the public again. Fortunately for us all, that time was last week. In just a few days, he has blessed the Internet with a myriad of pictures and videos demonstrating his many talents, including singing, dancing, throwing a football, lifting, running, and stripteasing. We must treasure each post dearly, because we never know when he might disappear again...
That was ass
That was bad
That was beast mode esque
That was classic cam
That was cool
That was cool
That was ELECTRIC
That was enjoyable. Thanks John Goodwin and Becker 
That was fast 
That was frickin incredible 
That was fun as fuck
That was girthy 
That was good leg kick, yeah?
That was goodwin, hilarious as usual
That was Halo 1 you plebe
That was horrendous tackling 
That was huge for me, couldn't have made progress without it
That was hysterical
That was incredible
That was incredible
That was incredible 
That was incredible 
That was insane 
That was inside the mod that went outside 
That was like 370 lmao
That was like a 45 yard throw as hard as he can
That was like a screen hook and ladder
That was like super benign hahaha. He didn't say anything
That was literally an all time run
That was my AT top 5 and it still holds 
That was my first guess, but that's proven false by the influx into the doctors world
That was my first reaction too. I thought the middle red part was like a coyote or some shit
That was my one choking experience 
That was one of my biggest Boston vs NY takeaways. If the Yankees won the World Series, you wouldn’t be able to tell walking around the next day. In Boston, you would know as soon as you walked out the door. 
That was one of the most awkward interactions of my life 
That was Pams bong 
That was quick...
That was really cool
That was SICK
That was similar in terms of trying to use money to blow up the existing FIFA structure and got major fan backlash 
That was so fucking sick
That was some crazy stuff on wieners last night, huh?
That was some giant balls there
That was super anticlimactic
That was super lame
That was the best decision he made as president
That was the best thing I’ve ever read
That was the greatest game of all time
That was the one I put on when you said you’d never heard the clock intro 
That was the top story for like 20 minutes lol
That was thielens fault. Didn’t even glance in the direction of the ball. 
That was tough, I whiffed on Canada. Ballet, Rita Moreno, and the far left one I was never gonna get lol.
That was unbelievable 
That was very legal and very cool
That wasn’t very cash money
That wasn’t very cash money
That way we don't have any holes in walls
That whale joke is actually hilarious
That White can shoot!
That white dude is not abiding by the theme
That white slug pic looks like a tube of goat cheese 
That whole drive was stupid with the penalties
That whole episode was my favorite part of the season
That whole story is a real life Oceans  a movie
That whole thing is a different lane to me. Skip was merciless to sherm but it was all about on the field stuff. He wasn’t calling him a pussy weakling, and sherm just got super personal while skip handled it pretty professionally
That why they call him Tiger “Gordon Bombay” Woods
That Wikipedia article on don Cordell is awesome
That wish can turn into a reality! Just say bye to the entire farm team
That works
That works 
That works for me. @Skimmer @Motorcycle Man hbu?
That would add a lot more to the New England - New York rivalry
That would be (almost) unimaginable 
That would be a cool D card
that would be a fun game haha
That would be almost possible if doctors worked for free ;)
That would be an act of God
That would be an even litter
That would be business bananas
That would be great
That would be hotter if we didn’t just watch both AFC East teams suck an egg
That would be nice :)
That would be Philadelphian levels of unacceptable 
That would be pretty fucked up if he traded $30 and then skipped town
That would be so Browns
That would be the best thing ever
That would be the most anticlimactic ending
That would be the smart thing to do
That would give me bad vibrations 
That would have been like choosing (half) North Korea over (half) South Korea 
That would kill SS hahaha
That would likely be around mid/end of September  
That would still be a 2 point safety (I think). Not the scenario I was looking for at least
That WVU play is unbelievably terrible 
That, except it's Trumps weiner 
That’s 6 inches 
That’s a brutal first round matchup 
That’s a close one. I think I take the under
That’s a compliment
That’s a first
That’s a good hot take
That’s a good one
That’s a lot if it’s actually just out of spite
That’s a lot of background tv
That’s a lot of singers 
That’s a lot of trash
That’s a lot, especially Parker. He was the definition of a mega bust and then immediately was pretty good
That’s a lot. But I’ll go with it if y’all want to
That’s a pretty good response 
That’s a problem at Holloman too and around the country. Time to offer free beer for those who get vaccinated 
That’s a real thing btw, I didn’t just make that up
That’s a solid pet peeve
That’s a solid top 3
That’s a straw man Jeff come on bruh
That’s a stretch but he’s been undoubtedly really really good. 
That’s a top tier gif lmfao
That’s a win for Biden 
That’s a yea
That’s actually a fair argument tho
That’s actually a hilarious and awesome challenge 
That’s actually absurd how expensive it is just to apply
That’s actually insane
That’s actually insane. My cousin is first year eligible for VP at GS this month and she’s been working there for 7 years.
That’s actually one of the more honest and smart fraud schemes lol 
That’s actually so funny tho. Becker is both “it’s terrible that there are only 7 teams who’ve ever won a CFP game.” and “there should only be like 7 teams who should ever see the CFP”
That’s actually super interesting
That’s actually unbelievable 
That’s actually what they say lol
That’s all gobbledygook. I only care what the QB Guru @🥇🥇🥇 thinks
That’s all I have to say about this. God bless America. Still the best country in the history of human civilization 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
That’s all want to happen
That’s alright, low expectations are the key to success 
That’s also largely true of right wingers in liberal areas anyway
That’s an amazing video 
That’s an interesting thought. But I feel like you’d need an obvious mismatch to push your blocker at a specific oblique angle, since getting by them is hard enough anyway.
That’s another 2020 groupme trope btw (though still in its infancy)
That’s another BC senior year staple song 
That’s bananas 
That’s basically just Connor Trevor and Pomps. You’re already tight with James
That’s basically what the videos were saying except no mention of mutations 
That’s because my shots are GPS-aided inertial navigation system and laser guided
That’s because they didn’t have both bash brothers the first time
That’s because you clearly don’t think you are, he is
That’s because you don’t have Kelleher athletic genes
That’s because you listen to pod save America 
That’s broken
That’s brutal
That’s called “the Bernie supporter”
That’s called “The Emyr”
That’s called Lafayette Square
That’s cap 
That’s crazy
That’s delusional, even without the “collusion”
That’s different than the famous r/WSB infinite leverage glitch
That’s effectively the point of what intel is. There are people whose entire jobs are dedicated to this, called “red teams”. The general framework relies on what we assess they are capable of, what their intentions are, what they have done in the past, and what they train to now. How accurate are these assessments, we will find out when the shooting starts #SpringBreakTaiwan2027
That’s EUCOM retard
That’s fair
That’s fucking hilarious
That’s gonna be the most problem child on the planet
That’s gonna bother don more than another impeachment lmao
That’s gonna require some thought
That’s good. I was going off this “In Utah, Fox said, pharmacists are advised to stick to the FDA emergency use guidelines, which dictate that there are five doses.”
That’s goody Kwanzaa bar crawl territory
That’s great great grandparents 
That’s GSP-Serra odds @The Big Dick Bandit 
That’s honestly one of the most self centered posts I’ve ever seen
That’s how I describe y’all when anybody asks about the fortrots 
That’s how iconic that homer is
That’s hysterical
That’s incredible if so
That’s insane distance to bodyweight ratio lol
That’s it?  I feel like a 10 min ride is $10
That’s leadership right there
That’s like a rugby play
That’s like bodybuilder on a cut body fat levels 
That’s like the fourth one and he’s bricked them all
That’s like the third crazy escape 
That’s like tipping 50 cents instead of forgetting to tip
That’s literally the opening scene of rick and Morty season 4. Jessica posting hot selfies from her grandmothers funeral
That’s mahoosic notch, aka “the hardest mile”. Also the funnest IMO
That’s means he’s basically flip rivers tho
That’s my brand I guess
That’s my fault. I assumed it was unnecessary because we wouldn’t be a bunch of whiny prima donnas. Terrible assessment by me
That’s my favorite meme of the year by far
That’s my pick. High quality ceviche 
That’s my point entirely. “How it’s always been done” is the reason why
That’s my question, and does it matter if I wanna cash out and immediately reinvest?
That’s next on the list 
That’s no different from every week tho
That’s not actually him is it
That’s not an official line btw just me asking
That’s not an SF86 is it?
That’s not out at AT&T that’s for damn sure
That’s not the same thing?
That’s nothing. You ever heard of bishop sycamore??
That’s one of my fav C&H strips that I didn’t get until I was older
That’s one of the best endings I’ve ever seen
That’s one of the hardest cleanest QB hits I’ve ever seen
That’s one of the worst calls I’ve ever seen
That’s only because the fake news media is doing everything they can to crash the economy so it will hurt trumps reelection
That’s our home team 💪🏼
That’s pretty gay 
That’s prob 2 hours plus each way every day
That’s really fucked up. Sorry to hear that
That’s really ironic since the difference between trump and Hillary was less than the third party vote totals in many/most swing states :(
That’s really sad if Marcus can share a happy life update without getting scolded for politics
That’s retarded! Why?!
That’s right it was a Saturday at 1 am outside lower. Aka one of the most high trafficked areas at that time. 
That’s right, residents are fucking poors
That’s rough buddy 
That’s so dumb. He literally was in bounds when we hit him
That’s so flabbergasting that I actually don’t believe it
That’s so fucking dumb
that’s so ironic 
That’s so sad
That’s so sad
That’s so weak
That’s some all time bad clock management 
That’s some dank herb 
That’s some interesting data goodwin 
That’s still the dumbest thing I’ve ever done in my life
That’s such an incredible photo
That’s such BS
That’s such bullshit
That’s the best catch I’ve ever seen
That’s the best part about his alleged Russian golden shower party. Dude was SOBER
That’s the best photoshop every time
That’s the cleverest one I’ve ever seen
That’s the downside of repeatedly kicking Marcus from here
That’s the governments scapegoat attempt yes 
That’s the greatest catch I’ve ever seen
That’s the meanest thing I’ve ever heard Darrow say
That’s the million dollar question and I don’t think anybody knows, including Putin. The least dramatic scenario is that it becomes a frozen conflict (similar to the Donbas war) and Russia’s economy toils until Putin somehow leaves office. 
That’s the most effective argument to me. But again, it’s also the case with the non-Covid related bad health choices.
That’s the most italian thing you’ve ever said goody
That’s the navy you jamoke
That’s the opposite of my handicap opinions
That’s the points for dragging everything as far to the left as possible 
That’s the pussiest bullshit I’ve ever heard
That’s the ratio of deez nuts to your mouth
That’s the same approach I took. Except I went NO instead of WFT for the south and IND instead of CLE for middle America historic team. WFT would have a bigger claim if they didn’t just change their name
That’s the second best “hub”
That’s the thing tho. He thought he was safe in the studio so he was a total jerk
That’s the thing! It’s quotable for no fucking reason. Like the jokes are just so random, yet it works
That’s the troof 
That’s the worst fucking call I’ve ever seen
That’s the worst one I’ve ever seen
That’s their whole thing that makes them special
That’s them
That’s tough to beat
That’s tough. Force him to get a job at anywhere with a schedule just to establish some work pattern first. That’s possibly the biggest hurdle. 
That’s true but let’s not pretend the owners don’t make hundreds of millions while doing extremely little
That’s unbelievable
That’s unbelievable 
That’s up there for sure. 
That’s what @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD shots look like off the tee 
That’s what happens when you host a bunch of white nationalists and then the Union has to remind you what’s up
That’s what happens when you move from butt fuck Egypt to a major American city 
That’s what happens when you root for the dodgers 
That’s what I do now lmao
That’s what I expected but didn’t want to assume
That’s what I figured
That’s what I say too when I lose another couple $1000 to FriendZone
That’s what I thought too at first hahahaha
That’s what I thought. But it’s too coordinated for that
That’s what I was thinking too, except my sofa is not a sectional
That’s what it was before, but it does allow for a lot of fuckery
That’s what Marcus says too when he sells out for the CCP
That’s what matters, and that’s what there’s data on
That’s what my little brother said too
That’s what peak performance looks like
That’s what she said
That’s what started Rob kardashians legal career IIRC
That’s what they said about alcohol too
That’s what they’re saying, but he was also putting up a QBR of 5 when he was pulled 
That’s what you call a high stakes gamble
That’s what you get for mailing it in after week 4
That’s what you said about Joe Bauer too 
That’s what you said when we made the bet too. Way to be consistent
That’s what’s known as the Red-Brown Alliance
That’s where I throw my hands up. I know nothing about scouting QBs for a pro career.
That’s why America is glad it can count on your vote for Biden
That’s why I didn’t bother trying to keep the secret. It was obviously Marcus 
That’s why I have to make suicide jokes in here. Because it’s extremely frowned upon at work lmao
That’s why I was so confused
That’s why she lives on CT. So she doesn’t have to drive for family functions 
That’s why the tutes will stay employed
That’s why they call him Mikey Mulligans 
That’s why they call him Touchdown Tay
That’s why they call you the throat goat
That’s why they’re trying to make digital ids which becomes your key so it’s harder to steal that
That’s why triple deke glove side remains the elite PK move in the NHL
That’s why we have the trusty old gulag
That’s why we’re the only people he invited to his wedding ✊🏼
That’s why you draft 250 teams so you have every player on every team
That’s why you need a putter in your office. For self defense
That’s why you’re the arbiter of comedy Joe 
That’s... a good point
That’s... pretty good not gonna lie
That's $7.5MM per year btw (practicing for tomorrow)
THATS A 500 POUND TIRE
That's a bingo 
That's a contentious point. if a fetus has Down's syndrome, is it okay for the parents to abort on solely those grounds?
That's a damn good card. I also remember watching it with Emyr because I was a huge BJ penn fan and he got straight wrecked by McDonald and he kept saying idk why you like that guy
That's a divine middle finger to those who bet on the redskins if I've ever seen one
That's a fair point, but I'm skeptical of Trump and Tillersons motives, (and I'd certainly like to see their tax returns). Russia is a bully and an international enemy and they should be confronted with big dick American strength, because Putin has proven to take full advantage of any leeway he can get.
That's a fucking touchdown!!
That's a giant middle finger to a legit minor leaguer to live his dream
That's a good article. I drink coffee everyday 
That's a good moral
That's a good one actually
That's a good question haha
That's a good spicy take by the prof
That's a hilarious costume 
That's a no because nobody has T Mobile
That's a strawman
That's a touchdown!
That's about $150 in drinks for a $150 ticket. So I'm overspending by like $100...
That's absurd hahaha. I wonder which other pitchers have that advantage / disadvantage 
That's absurd you don't have a Vendor management system for automated billing. Golddicks uses "Prowand" so I guess you can suggest that if you want kudos
That's actually awesome Jeff
That's all I have lol
That's amazing...
That's backdoor sluts 9 right?
That's because he was sick that day and had already done powerlifting for like 3 hours before hand and ate a burrito but he was still the fastest one out there
That's because you send her money every time you win a battle
That's called "ad hominem"
That's contingent on if he's first tho
That's coo
That's cool because I didn't get the reference either
That's correct actually
That's definitely not right
Thats definitely not the real moral
That's disgusting. Nobody should ever do that
That's Emyr's number
That's everybody's question
That's exactly the point I'm trying to make. When you spy on people (which is inherently unconstitutional), you will discover lots of illegal shit. However, if that illegal activity is not for the sole goal of killing innocents, the spying is not justified in my opinion. On the other hand, if there is reasonable evidence that a suspect is trying to kill innocents en masse, we better not risk that happening. 
That's exactly what lots of folks have been saying. At the same time, it's possible for these things to be big news stories that don't result in immediate impeachment or nuclear war. 
That's fair I can see the argument. I just think Cams performance this year and past demonstrated skill set is enough to vault him for me
That's fair. I used hyperbole
That's fair...
That's for one season
That's from memory. Not sure if right lol
That's fucking hilarious bahahahaha
That's fucking hilarious hahaha
That's fucking hilarious hahahaha
Thats fucking impressive though
That's gif is fucking hysterical 
That's going on now. QB accuracy
That's gonna be a great fun fact for the "Meet the New AD" article
That's gotta be one of the best intramural / fantasy / etc team names I've ever heard
That's gross
That's hilarious and not at all surprising
That's hilarious hahahaha
That's his TLDR in his own words at the beginning of the memo
that's honestly my #1 beef with the Republican Party. Even if they're right and climate change is a hoax, the absolute worst thing that climate change funding would do is CAUSE MORE SCIENCE
Thats how the world works though. Nobody ever wants to underspend a surplus, lest their future funding decrease.
That's ironic because Matt Serra looks like a diglett
That's it
That's just incredible
tHaTs jUsT mAnNy bEiNg MaNnY
That's just my phenomenal story telling skills
That's like a perfect example of a quality post
That's like a super famous row of houses
That's like saying taking it exclusively up the butt means you're still a virgin
That's like the thing I'm least surprised by
That's literally straight out of GTA V
That's me! Anesto loves ME!!
That's more complicated than baseball. It's just RS^2/RA^2
That's more or less in order
That's my number two
That's not a power rankings you buffoon
That's not a 🐐, he's clearly facing the wrong direction 
That's not even the full trade ;)
That's not the answer, but it's a hint
That's not the biggest problem with my team...
That's not to say that an individual helps the team the most in baseball. That would be basketball because there are the fewest players on the court at once 
That's not what their suing about. They're suing over their pay from US Soccer, not the payout of the Women's World Cup champions from FIFA
That's not what they want you to think though
That's one of the most awkward endings ever hahaha
That's one version
That's perfectly accurate
That's plausible. But yeah the 7 countries banned were identified by the Obama admin
That's possible. My thoughts were how ineffective steph was off the dribble in the post season, whereas he  was still highly effective off the catch and shoot and driving off the feed. 
That's pretty atypical
That's pretty cool. It might be a negotiation tactic to get a better lease offer haha
That's pretty funny. Would consider for next season
That's pretty much the whole conclusion of my thesis, yeah
That's reigning NBA Champion and Finals MVP bitch to you
That's retarded
That's saying catching is the only part of being a WR. That's ridiculous
That's shitty
THATS SHORY
That's so cool, which one?
That's such horse shit. I'm against any rule that benefits the owners
That's super ironic that Seattle has the $15 minimum wage rule, and Amazon goes ahead and does this pilot store there
That's the Asian way
That's the attitude!
That's the best thing you've said all day
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard
That's the first ever mention of Hitler in the New York Times. Absolutely mind blowing...
That's the first one eliminated haha
That's the last SAT date on the site. There was one this weekend but I have to go to my brothers graduation. And I'd rather make it fun than just do it in NY and be lame
That's the most Browns thing ever
That's the most this season. Last season there were 2 higher: Whitebread 173.7 and Goody 173.2, both against 24B. 
That's the opposite of the point I'm making. He stood for progressive ideals, and that pissed off angry rural white people
That's the other half for me lol
That's the pulitzer prize winning NYT journalist of the definitely-not-historically-false "1619 Project"
That's the question innit?
That's the saddest part. I didn't even do anything, just clicked the trending topic and those were the first responses . 
That's the same every time, then the where... changes 
That's the Steven Wu I remember right there. Out of nowhere with random shit, asking to hang out or join your intramural team or some shit
That's the Tom Hanks Cold War movie right?
Thats true for all doctors though. And also come on let's not pretend PP exists to provide cheap conception help...
That's true of a lot of the old players though, across many sports. Talking about "league got soft" types of comments
That's true, and you drove us home, which was very nice
That's very fair Jeff
That's well in the repertoire at this point haha
That's what allowed Russia to confidently step in and be as influential and powerful as they are.
That's what he signed up for...
That's what I meant. You get the option to exercise the buyback at a stroke price $0 after the season 
That's what I thought, but a lot of the contact occurs before the ball is even caught and the blockers don't know if a kick is going to be a touchback or not
That's what I want^
That's what I was for RHA for 1.5 years haha
That's what I was wondering by "trick answer"
That's what I would pick if I bought a ticket
That's what I wrote lol
That's what I'm saying though. Those are legal reasons, not business reasons.
That's what I'm saying. Who would set prices? Is insurance still free market? How would the new system be different from the status quo?
That's what spurred my question. The O Line is now in absolute shambles
That's what they've been doing in a lot of state congressional races. It's been "working" in that the Dems have outperformed their expectations across the board, but not in that they've actually won anything
That's why I always put a No Smoking sign on my door
That's why you gotta be a G in a Gi
That's why you're bcsuperfan22
That's why you're wrong
Thaughts?
The "___ Test" tests if a movie has at least 2 female characters who talk to each other about anything but a man. Something like 60% of movies fail this test
The "should" part is completely independent of what I'm trying to say
The "we lost by the way" guy wasn't the guy who did the whole clearing up deal. Idk who said what after that
The #metoo movement not doing hot in china
The #original
The /r/NBA is strong with this one
The @ before the (👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 makes it look like a Marrill
The @#JustFacts✅ are that they cheated and they got no punishment that was still their response
The “abu XYZ” part of the Islamic names 
The “fun-ness” of the movies is a lost art that doesn’t exist anymore. Doesn’t mean it fails to hold up.
The “last digit of your like is your new ____” are the worst posts on IG and the posters deserve a cell in the gulag 
The “masks are infringing upon my rights people” deserve a one way ticket to the gulag 
The “progressive pogrom” joke also really did not age well
The “source”
The “wins are all that matter” dudes were saying that Jimmy G was a top 10 QB
The 10000 rats are the X factor. If they're World War Z zombie style rats, its a no brainer.  If theyre just like normal rats, theyre wolf food.
The 1984 BC - Bama game that @Legitimate Business Man referred to a few days ago is steaming on YouTube in 10 minutes 
The 2002 WS loss to the angels was up there too
The 2015 boat party seems so long ago
The 2019 Masters probably saved several thousand marriages
The 2020 giants are as good as the 2020 dodgers
The 24 is actually 🤮 
The 25% of Bernie voters who voted for not hillary because their singular vote wouldn’t matter 
The 28th then
The 3/4 turn is the most frustrating part of the draft IMO
The 30 for 30 on Reggie Miller vs the Knicks is a top 3 for me
The 3v5 thing is triggering my OCD that I didn't know I had
The 4pm slate
The 538 model is a very ambitious effort. I wonder how accurate it is
The 538 model is highly flawed. The literal creators have basically said as much on their podcast for the past week
The 6th amendment may let some criminals walk free, but it still still the write law
The 9 year old could be an analyst on ESPN
The abandoned perpetrator car
The ACC just does it right 
The actual ACC team this sucks most for is prob VaTech. If they get stuck remaining in the ACC while Clemson and Miami leaves
The adams Taylor trade was all about need. I didn’t think adams was overrated or whatever.
The AFC East needs to be relegated 
The AFC is so stacked it’s crazy
The AFCN and AFCE teams would be unfairly hit but that might be the best solution
The Alamogordo course is a 68 handicap, meaning if you’re a +8 handicap, you should hope to shoot +4 on the course
The Alie is very important for Mo Alie Cox’s name
The all-coronavirus team is stacked
The All-Headcase team probably wouldn’t look too different than an all-pro team
The alt right is way better than antifa tbh
The alternative is to marginally increase the quality of the players I receive until it meets an acceptable threshold
The altitude plus usual 25 knot winds in the gordo makes golf frustratingly difficult most of the time. Yesterday no wind = great score
The American century championship that is going on now
The analytics say he is all time terrible 
The anesto comments are getting a bit spicy
The anime weapons episode is an all time classic
The Anne frank museum is the hottest ticket. We didn't make it there for lack of time. But yeah I've heard the same but no personal experience
The announcers are consistently making me agree with goodys take on mahomes
The announcers are flabbergasted
The announcers literally just said “Red Sox fans are wondering why on earth we traded that guy”
The answer is exactly between your first and second answers
The answer is obvious. Captain Kirk MVP
The answer is obviously Michigan state 
The answer is Remember the Titans you philistines
The answer to free market problems is a free market answer :)
The answer to that question for me is usually where they were at their best. If they have multiple bests, it’s both teams
The answer was avant garde btw
"The answers are:
Dance monkey
Someone you loved

The anti vax people can die of covid 
The anti-TT
The argument for no Biden helping Bernie is obvious: Bernie’s in second place and if the first place drops out, he becomes the front runner. But I disagree with the argument for him benefiting most, because he has universal name recognition, and yet low general popularity. As the race evolves, the party loyalists and other major factions are likely look elsewhere to put their eggs. And media coverage is naturally a huge part of where that nest is 
The argument I could see though is that a baseball player only hits every 9 ABs no matter what. Having zero talent in the lineup can seriously hurt
The argument with your girl friends, not the whole 350 messages I just read
The article mentioned that Adidas had to up their bid for one recruit to outbid another company/school, so there's at least one more major player here
The article says the homeless guy sued the couple, but he also had a new camper. The couple had a new car and bunch of new jewelry, and they countersued. So yeah, both idiots and scumbags. 
The artificial inflation of prices by hospitals to account for the insurance non-payments pisses me off so much tho. Not blaming the hospital for gaming the system per se against an insurance company that’s trying to screw them at every turn, but it is ridiculous the charges they apply for jack shit
The AthDept better fucking already know that. I think we're already too close to the edge there, and a loss like you described might be the passing of the torch
The Atlantic wrote a piece about it literally today - https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/why-big-city-dominance-problem-democrats/617161/
The audience being tourists is the most important part
The Austin trip was up there
The Austria-Hungarian empire happened once 
The auto industry is also going to get hit hard
The average person is better off now than ever before. Let's not blow up the system that got us here 
The Avril Lavigne conspiracy is an all timer
The Ayatollah hanging with the Houthis. Not surprised. 
The back to back Th sounds is tough
The backdrop of which is the DOD announced about a month ago that we’re withdrawing from certain parts of Iraq by Sept 2025 and end of CJTF OIR by Sept 2026. So I’m curious what that means for me, if anything. And curious if the trump administration changes that decision at all
The bad guy street is nocturn alley
The ball is hit by the batter in fair territory. Ok?
The ball that hit the foul pole 80 feet up?
The banning of 3rd party APIs has to be one of the industry’s biggest unforced errors of all time right
The baseball thing is an interesting comparison because on one hand, great point. On the other, it’s still an athletic competition between humans, not humans vs a test with objectively right and wrong answers you can look up
The basic game is completely free. There are a series of "adventures", which are basically expansions you have to pay for, and there are "expansions" that are a just a series of packs with new cards. You can buy the packs or earn them by playing the game. 
ThE bEaRs ArEnT ExCiTiNg
The bears did it with the Fridge in the 80s. And the Chiefs with Dontari Poe not too long ago. 
The bears Nick Foles signing is unconscionable 
The bears were literally the best possible pick last year 
The bears were the team in 2018, when goody said it was a terrible pick and then they went 12-4
The Beatdown in Beantown is gonna be way better
The Beatdown in Beantown is worth it

The Becker’s head upside down is still my favorite photoshop
The beer must've started to kick in
The bench is a great place to put your phone and water bottle when doing lunges or something 
The benchmark has been set for a replacement level starting QB
The Bernie propaganda is upvoted by Russian accounts
The best advice
The best argument against collusion tho is that this offseason was going to be really weak and GMs knew that for several years ahead, so they made all their big moves ahead of the offseason, making it even more barren
The best fantasy season of all time was LT in like 2005. He averaged like 30 ppg 
The best football team of all time just lost the super bowl to a backup QB. Bruh I’m ready for anything
The best I've ever seen. Caveat was that it was mid blizzard, and half the mountain was closed. But still totally worth it
The best line was when he chastised Tao for letting his crush walk out with “bing bong, click clack, and Charlie Chan”
The best part about going to an Italian restaurant is reading the menu out loud in a dramatic accent 
The best PG of the decade is RAYMOND FELTON 🤣🤣🤣
The best posts are the ones that spawn big arguments 
The best team doesn’t have to face the best team because they are the best team. The rest of the AFC East is trash and that’s the primary reason for the easy SOS. Both are true. 
The best to ever do it
The Beto and Bernie ones are amazing
The better you are at running the easier it gets
The Biden Bernie race is over, but reiterating that going super left would’ve been a gift to Trump
The big Alaskan looking guy with the heavy MG got a lot of screen time with no development though. Forrest Whittaker too sorta. Other than that I thought it was good
The Big Dick Tiny Balls Bandit
The big question is if the UAVs are joined with ballistic missiles later on to choreograph time of impact. If that happens then this is a lot bigger than what I just suggested 
The big question right now is what will the realignment changes do and to what degree
The biggest and best news is that Russia hasn’t yet gotten publicly pissed off. Hopefully that doesn’t change today
The biggest finding is probably the parity between Team Flyhole and Team OTF
The biggest lie of that movie is that all the pilots are in perfect shape
The biggest lowkey positive is that the dodgers HATE Correa so that’s a small win
The biggest macro story is the Latino vote, which has gone heavy heavy Trump vs 4 years ago
The biggest ripoff I can remember was the finals care package for parents to send their kids 
The biggest thing is that they don’t have their own separate budget, it’s under dept of navy
The biggest thing with mac is his gigantic gut
The Bill Coughlin closing the blinds story is also the cringiest experience of my life
The bill coughlin white coat pics still haunt my dreams 
The Bill Mueller (great giant) disrespect 
The bills and colts are both so sad
The bills are so fun
The birds is truly the best social media 
The black Israelites who marched at Barclays Center wear purple. Jaylen Brown tweeted support of them and then retracted saying he thought it was a black fraternity. 
The Black Sox scandal is still famous literally 100 years later
The black square on IG (remember that lmfao) was the pinnacle
The blacks had a white holder?! SCANDAL
The blind side is the new Columbus day
The blockchain doesn't have to be anonymous, does it?
The blue check is going from “yep this is the real person” to “probably a crypto scammer or right wing nut job”
The blurb writer was probably shaking with rage, and I don’t blame him
The Bock Clan Claims are my favorite thing 
The books have major storylines that aren’t in the show at all so they’ll have to wrap them up somehow
The borders in the Middle East don't really mean shit. Kurdistan is already essentially its own country and I don't think drawing a border there will do anything. The sectarianism and tribalism is the root of the problems and if that doesn't end the place will never be peaceful. As for today, I actually am more on team Assad than I am on team rebel. Dictatorship appears to be better than a rebel takeover, as shown in Iraq, Yemen, and Libya. 
The botched snap, Breece gather and dive was a top 5 Jets play of the game
The Bourque household pulls in a quarter million dollars and can’t afford red zone
The Bourques are probably millionaires by now 
The boys are elated
The boys claim they are all being treated poorly because of one man's (cartman) actions. So they protest like radical feminists: march down the hallway with their dicks out because they're not ashamed of being men 
The bright side is that more people are covered now than ever before. But the average family is seeing their premiums skyrocket
The browns are #7 hahaha
The Browns need no context 
The Bryson : Marcus take is pretty sharp in that they both are contrarian just to be contrarian 
The Buckley Club has become a favorite of mine as they're staunch anti-trump conservatives
The Bucks are Giannis and all swingmen
The bud light robot and the hopper tied commercials were flops
The bulls are having major chemistry issues. Few days ago Butler and DWade were bitching that nobody besides them seems to care, and today Rondo puts a picture of him with KG and Pierce on IG captioning "if there's anything wrong on this team, it's the leadership"
The bunker fiasco too was blatant cheating 
The Butt Safety!
The cake is a lie
The cancel yale thing is being propagated by right wing trolls. And it’s working 
The canucks picked three random letters

The cast I saw was different than the original, but I’ve heard LMM is worst actor (compared to the rest). Did y’all get that impression?
The catcalling, not the gay sex. Although that also would’ve been a first time experience for me
The categories could all be “any player ever” and I don’t think I’d get it
The Cavs are horrible GMs
The Celtics are just so casually efficient 
The CFP has been an inarguably great change
The chance they get the offsides is worth the penalty
The character development is actually extremely strong. And they make fun of how awkward people are as good as any show
The character development was amazing. The gameplay was a bit chunky but I didn't even care
The chargers tried so hard to lose that game hahaha
The chart is the vaccines administered not cases
The CHAZ is one of my favorite “I cannot believe this is real” stories of all time
The CHAZ spawned out of a police brutality protest and then they created their own police system and shot 2 teenagers within a week lmao
The chiefs (bad) have been running the NFL for decades. 10 years ago, there was an alliance between the Jags Titans and Browns to take them down. They failed. Fast forward to today, the Israeli Basketball Association has surprisingly merged with the NBA. The NFL execs and refs are paralyzed, and the Browns Jags Titans out of nowhere beat the chiefs in 6 consecutive games
The chiefs are fucking boring
The Chiefs were whiny bitches this year 
the china stuff is the only truly real bad thing he said IMO. this new one is bad, but it's what the media (both mass and social) have been peddling for like a year now so i blame him less. the china one was straight up bad
The Chinese are the worst tourists by an insurmountable magnitude 
The choking convo was all time
The Chris Sale White Sox throwback jerseys story is an all time classic 
The CHVRCHES album was a bit disappointing 
The cities where the cops have deescalated and shown empathy have had the least problems. Clearly don doesn’t wanna hear that though
The claim is never struck out in little league
The claim was always little league
The closest thing I can think of is that “new” art style of chessboard like squares
The closest thing I've seen to the start of a solution was provided by the OSU attacker's facebook post:
"The closest thing to this is the hellfire kill of Solemani in Jan 2020. Iran responded with a dozens of ballistic missiles targeting aircraft hangers and empty on US bases in Iraq. Nobody was kinetically hurt (some TBI diagnosed later).

That is what’s primarily guiding my assessment. "
The closing the blinds moment was the closest I’ve ever been to a slasher movie victim in my life
The clown show continues
The coaching factor also cannot be overstated. We see NFL teams boom and bust every year with little else but a coaching change.
The color pins are different missions. Red is ammo drops. Green is radio transistors. We had 8 missions in 2 days. And we all had paintball guns so the whole thing was with them
The colts and pulling some fake sub out at the last second before a kick, all of which backfired. Name a more iconic duo 
The Colts ruined Lucks career. He gave them everything he had to the point that it was destroying him both mentally and physically. Literally zero shame in doing what he did. Sucks for the fans, but they booed him when he walked off, so screw them too
The Comm Squadron and the Med Group
The comments are hysterical too haha
The Commodore
The community garden which is topsoil thrown on cardboard is one of my personal favorites
The concept at least
The concept is hysterical. But I guess I don’t get what “taking on airline safety” means
The conditions of the payment are unconstitutional 
the consensus is that the American response been an unambiguous disaster 
The constant mind changing of foreign policy decisions massively affects the intel community on a daily basis
The Continental is a "bar" that serves 5 shots for 10 dollars, or during happy hour, 7 shots for 12 dollars with the purchase of a $3 beer. I put bar in quotations because it's more like a black room with puke everywhere
The contracts all gotta have “in case of crazy shit that cancels the season” clauses right?
The conundrum is analogous to the Liz Cheney thing in the GOP right now. She rejects The Big Lie, but because the populist message is what the people want, she is now a pariah. And yes trump is Hamas, the dude in power who promises all these lies, but he fights so he’s popular.
The coral thing really pissed me off
the cornball brotha is in
The corner. 24
The countries who the EU was hoping would provide the jets did not provide the jets 
The COVID lockdown houses groups were so fucking funny
The coyotes one is like postmodern and sorta Native American style. I fux with it.
The creativity is just so refreshing after 15 years of  stagnant play calling
The crickets lead me to believe this is a no
The crowd then broke in to stop the show and when he finally was hit with water gun to calm down he challenged Danny to double or nothing claiming he would get him that time but Danny said, again paraphrasing, "nigga fuck you I just beat your ass without you getting any fucking points. Shit nigga how you think you beat me" and Luka and I laughed and laughed and laughed and then left
The crowd would probably boo but fuck haters 
The crowd would’ve exploded  
The Cubes has been studying the Kelleher plan 
The current “pick 3” debates a-raging
The current name/photo shenanigans is certainly not elite
The current system doesn’t. Debt forgiveness does. And whether I agree or disagree, my forecast is that some sort of debt forgiveness policy will happen within 10 years
The curse of the trade is real
The cyber is so good. These kids, my 10 year old son likes computers. But the security of cyber is very important. They're not doing a good job. I'll fix it. 
The daily 90% dick pics were so fucking funny
The dates between messages is the cherry on top
The days of first second and third option are dying and dying fast
The deadline is actually tn. I was a day early yesterday because I used the groupme reminder date. I’ll leave it to Goody for official commissioner stuff
The Deans wife (also an admin) didn't side with the SJW students in banning potentially racist Halloween costumes, saying its not her place to tell students what they can and can't wear.  SJWs are calling for the deans resignation
The debuting of the 5 o’clock shadow bitmoji is one of my favorite moments in this groupme history
The Deed baby
The deliberations are ongoing
The demographics of Bourque Bros vs JT’s classmates lol
The Dems shut down the government but then caved after 2 days after gaining nothing
The denunciations seem hollow…
The Ders are trash
The detail in 4 was boring but it was important and insightful, IMO. In book 5 it was just fluff 
The difference seems to be Jones vs AR (Chan side) vs Jones vs wild card (my side)
The direction of their probabilities over time is generally right, fwiw
The disrespect 
The DOD annual suicide report was released Friday and it is with great pleasure that I report that active duty is are not worse than the general public adjusted for demographics 💪🏼 
The Don bet is probably in your favor at this point. Still pretty confident in the GRRM bet
The Doug Flutie moment, the Mac shirtless moment, and the 1v1 against Danny Luna... Missed all of them :(
The Dr Pepper contest always feels so exploitative
The dreamer kinda sucked tho 🫤 
The dude cannot not get in trouble, even when he's literally being told to do not post something because he's gonna get in trouble
The dude is a leftie in every way except immigration. He's against free trade for Christ sake
The dude is unreal: mandates extremely restrictive vaccine schedule that is enforced by massive fines, resulting in vaccines being thrown away. Now decides the cost of waiting is too high, after insisting his shut down was genius and the only correct way. All the while doing a book tour and winning a fucking Emmy for his incredible Covid response. 
The dude on the right is Ahmed Al Shara, aka Abu Mohammed al Jolani, president of Syria. He was Al Qaeda for most of his adult life. He rebranded his group a few times over the course of the Syrian civil war (Al Qaeda > Al Nusra > JFS > HTS). Then in Dec last year they overthrew Assad. Now he’s shaking hands with the POTUS and negotiating sanctions relief. It’s insane.
The eagles are good despite last week
The early Fox call of Biden winning has completely altered the narrative 
The east is the new G league
The effect of American entry won the war, he says it explicitly. And Wilson being terrible to American critics has nothing to do with the actual war itself. 
The efficiency of a meeting is inversely related to the number of people in the meeting
The Eminem album is impressive rapping but not really enjoyable music 
The emojis are just the icing on the cake
The Emyr Goody circlejerk is skrong
The end of homophobic slurs occurred while we were at BC
The English radio stations in Qatar said Kuh Tar so it’s not wrong per se
The EO was terrible, and the statement about firing the AG is staggering. But firing the AG is totally within the president's authority; that's not unique to trump. Of course, the manner in which it's done certainly is...
The Eras Tour dwarfs any Drake tour 
The ethnic anthem of white people ✊🏼
The EU elections happened this weekend. People are skeptical of the EU across Europe, and far right nationalism ain’t going away boys
The European mind cannot comprehend this
The exciting parts of baseball are balls in play. More than HRs and Ks. I don’t like shitting on analytics but they’ve (correctly) prioritized the HR and accepted the risk of the K, resulting in fewer balls in play.  
The existence of the patriot is obviously unclassified. The details about how it acquires, tracks, guides on, and kills its target are 🤫 
The existing one
The experts are saying they don’t think the Assad regime is going to survive 
The extra life and it's expiration date is an interesting kink. I assume it would mean you'd play slightly more risky until you lose/ until week 8
The face isn’t cracked. One of the tungsten plates on the bottom popped off
The face of a man who is NOT happy B school is over
The face of the best golfer in the Foxtrot Hotel, and the dominant winner of the Sweetens Open
The fact that Bloomberg spent millions of dollars just to lose and hurt his brand along the way demonstrates poor decision making that I don’t want in a president 
The fact that Bonix has had a better career than Lance makes me angry
The fact that its possible to be upset about an 11 game win streak before the all star break is shitty about the NBA
The fact that Russia didn’t prioritize gaining and maintaining air superiority is puzzling to me 
The fact that someone can arbitrarily determine how much future value for present value balance is acceptable is ridiculous 
The fact that that exists and is done by probably millions of people around the world is the biggest revelation of this study
The fact that the bot called Joe a has been dad is incredible 
"The fact that the jets haven’t been shit on this entire convo is BS and it stops now. 

LOLJETS WILSON SUCKS"
the fact that they were on full vacation mode literally as a Civil War was brewing in their home city is under appreciated
The fact that Trump gets his "info" from Reddit/4chan may be a story. The identify of the original poster is not a story. CNN threatened to doxx him for pure revenge purposes
The fact that we’re using espn draft value projections to determine savings is retarded
The fact that you drafted Jordy Nelson is pretty ironic now
The fact that your dad knows about 90s rap feuds and P Diddys involvement is wayyy above expectation
The factors going into the ability to get separation are so nuanced. Things like 3 cone drill and shuttle are supposed to give some insight but it’s so much more than that. Like how do you measure “quality of fakes” or “ability to make hot reads” or “finding the gaps between coverage handoffs”
The facts here have been extremely warped
The fake news will say that’s 6 but they lie to you
The famous Delaware party that somehow went into our class updates book 
The famous Jewish space lasers post
The fan base sizes are orders of magnitude apart
The fantasy gods got mad at me. I’m Odysseus taunting Poseidon 
The fashion is hysterical haha
The fb posts are from the accuser. Showing that she's maybe not the most level headed girl
The FBI informant thing came out of nowhere a few days ago when Speaker Johnson said it, then he immediately rescinded
The FDA ordered 150 million of those $5 15 min COVID tests and expects to have tens of millions produced by september. I hope I'm not being too optimistic but this seems huge. 1) It allows for easier implementation of test-and-trace by orders of magnitude, and 2) It could allow for safer reopening of things like air travel, e.g. you can test negative immediately before boarding a flight
The Federalist and Breitbart are right wing too but they're absolute garbage
The Federalist?! I’ve never listened to their pod but man their site is miles too far right for me 
The FH are flooding DC this summer. Love it!
The FH are without doubt in the 99th percentile of sports knowledge. And yes that includes like John and Nick
The FH league is like the Bernie bros. They insist there’s nothing wrong with the product, and its demonstrable unpopularity is actually the fault of all the people who left who just don’t get it.
The FH Open
The FH-Marcus relationship^
"The FHs are all handsome, all around good guys*

*except JoeBourque"
The field is so slippery
The first 4 holes at UMD from the blacks are not easy…
The first baseman is Who.
The first being NFL teams of course
The first bench clearing brawl with no fans is gonna be so weird
The first comment was semi tongue in cheek btw. If you only care about trump and his inner circle being indicted, then yes it’s tiny taters
The first draft would be crazy
The first gif, not Howard dean 
The first half was all eagles because of the fumble TD
The first one for sure
The first pick doesn't matter, that's the point!

The fix is in

The fix is in against BC in two places at once
The flip side is that this could be a turning point for much of the American cultural forefront deciding that asymptomatic Covid is just something to shrug at

The food here is very bad lol. I feel bad for the picky eaters
The football
The Football Team has never missed the playoffs
The format is called best ball. Literally only draft, no waivers trades or lineup setting. It autosets your lineup to who performed best each week 
The former
The former. And it explodes. 
The fourth most popular sport is on though
The framing is dishonest. Cost of goods is still extremely high. This is not a winning hill for the Dems to die on
The franchise is OP
The free market would determine that
The free market would say that one would be less incentivized to fuck themselves over if they know there's no safety net
The free safety was playing QB spy. Totally ignored the WRs
The freedoms the US provides are unparalleled. There is no time or place in the history of the world that has allowed for more egalitarianism and equality. No far from perfect, but if you disagree with the flag and the country, I challenge you to find a better one.

The funniest part of that scene is that he demands a punt returner lmao
The funniest thing is that most of the first world sprays water up into their asshole before wiping, and none of us do that
The GA-6 election is pretty damn close. 66% reporting, Dem Jon Ossoff has 50.32%. He needs majority to win. If he doesn't, top 2 (other being Rep Karen Handel) have a run off in 2 days.
The game theory behind “I’m gonna be the asshole” is something
The game winning drive saw Watson get crushed for a sure blitz by 2 rushers, somehow stays up, hits a check down for a huge catch and run to the 10 for the winning FG
The game. The hauschka shank. 
The Gang of Eight bill
The garage shot with the realtor and the 2 of them talking really highlighted (low lighted?) how short he is
The Gers
The Gers
The Gettleman interviews on why he drafted Jones are something else. First he says he fell in love with Jones after seeing 3 series in the Senior Bowl. Then he says they want to follow the Green Bay model, where he sits for 3 years like Aaron Rodgers did. Then he's asked why he wouldnt draft someone to help Eli win now, he says "who knows? I might go out and get hit by a car tomorrow"
The Ghost Tour bit had me in tears
The Giants appreciate your concern
The Giants may suck, but I still watch every game!!!
The Giants wanted Miller bad, but the Yankees wanted Panik plus prospects. 
The giants went from one of the worst in the league to NFC Divisional in one year with zero personnel changes. Any team, 2 years 
The girl didn't disclose evidence to Rose's defense team
The girl I named was Ghostbuster, because it was a rainy ass day, and this SoBo hiker comes through wearing a tan rainsuit with a bright orange pack cover. And I’m like “oh my god it’s a ghost buster” and she’s like well I don’t have a trail name yet...
The girl with the dragon tattoo was a generally well liked movie but IMO it’s legit an all time great 
The girls go to the PC principal and complain, and the PC principle acknowledges that he's in a PC Pretzel because they're protesting non-violently and he can't tell them to put their dicks away because that's body shaming
The glitches are absurd
The goal is to enjoy it and make it my career. 
The goal is to help push the narrative to the world that KSA is the preeminent nation in the Middle East. If they think it’s accomplishing that goal, they will keep throwing money at it. If not, they will change course. That’s my take
The goal is to make non-stud keepers available for keeping for cheap, which currently is not the case
The goal is to provide an affordable basic level of care to the lower classes without fucking the healthcare market for everybody else
The goal of winning a soccer game
The goalie is completely guessing. That’s why I used the analogy of the punts because the ball bouncing is as random as the goalie action 
The goat is both dead and alive
The good part of this is that now whenever I play with becker I can force him to play the tips, which is one (of many) of my advantages over him

The guy is so erratic and such a liar that anybody who claims to know what he will actually do is lying
The guy is unreal 
The guy just wants to go around and have rallies and have dumbass rednecks cheer his name. Not kidding. 
The guy who beat his kids is the beltway elite
The guy who knocked mcgregor out mcgregors literal last fight
The guy who shot Reagan did so because he thought Jodie foster was hot 
The guys with large vertical deltas between the trend line are the outliers, eg Tua is more “team success” than individual

The harder loans are to get, the more it hurts the poor. Except for those who lenders are confident can pay it back on time (ie the high performing high school students)
The hat flip, the swimmer, the guy getting thrown in the water, the chair… so many amazing moments

The haters are having a field day right now

The infamous Steven Wu picture
The infographic about areas by most broadcast team makes sense. The one about second most broadcast team is bananas. 
The initial error on the money direction was a good sell, even if it was a mistake
The injured player possibly blowing this for Washington would unbelievably suck
"The insane left: don’t call the police if you see a friendly knife fight

The instructors played the terrorists. Other experienced students played the Iraqis. They wore the same clothes so it was challenging To deal with that
The intention is that it's more for emergency care
The interface is the real map around you. You literally walk around, there are Pokemon that spawn up, and you can catch them. You look through your camera and there's a Pokemon superimposed. There are poke stops preset on the map that give you items and are hotbeds for Pokemon. There are also gyms that you can go to to battle other people. 
The interviewer is so clearly like “i can’t believe this guy. He’s a child!”
The interviews are the opposite of what makes the manning cast good
The INTs weren't even the QBs fault. All of them were deflections off the receivers chests 
The Iranian missiles reportedly killed Iraqi soldiers, no reports on any American casualties. Iran cares about Iraqis even less than trump does. 
The Iranian revolution in 1979 is a good start 
The Irishman is very very good
The irony meter is broken 
The irony that 99.99% of China and Myanmar have never heard of a crab Rangoon is not lost on me
The irony!!

The jets are capped at 9. They can go higher, but humans can’t 
The jets had a blip of hope in like 2010, and are otherwise the laughing stock of the NFL. The bills hadn’t made the playoffs in like 20 years. The dolphins haven’t been relevant in 20 years either
The Jets loss is the only real ugly one there, IMO. So I guess nobody is arguing they're a world beater, but I still think they've got the chops to compete with any team
The Jets obviously didn’t trade for Rodgers to be their franchise QB
The jets playoff drought outlasts my friendship with 93% of you
The Jets, who have 1 winning season since 2010, are the runaway best of the three lmao
The Jews have been disliked as a minority for thousands of years. Don't have concrete reasons as to why, but Jewish persecution is well documented since biblical times 
The Jews shouldn’t get maternity because they get half the year off anyway
The JFB Hate List (BC Class of 2014 students edition) will always bring me joy

The joke is Marines eat crayons. He’ll get it guaranteed
The joke is the same as your riddle
The joke master strikes again
The Jokemaster does it again
The juicy part is that he got ousted because of a small contingent of republicans who are even more MAGA than him
The jump from Marcus to Becker is almost double the range from Jeff to Marcus
The Just Facts Coalition actually hates BC
The kamikaze?
The Kelleher book so far
The Kelleher Plan (tm)
The kelleher plan addresses this issue by weakening the barriers to entry for healthcare professionals and create a system where there isn’t a an artificial limitation on the supply of doctors 
The Kelleher Plan has nothing to do with the ACA in the first place.
The Kelleher Plan is ethically questionable for sure. It is not unfeasible. 
The key factors tho are 1) turnout is historically higher in midterms from college educated voters, but that might not be true anymore 2) Roe might turn out more women 3) Biden is extremely unpopular
The key point is everyone hates it.
"The key questions tho:
1) The PGA must have known the non-defectors would be furious. What was their plan to prevent a riot?
2) How long was this on the table? Who approached who?
3) Will the LIV defectors be treated any differently by the PGA, either financially or professionally?
4) What extent will the KSA have any decision making sway? "
The kids should’ve not worn MAGA hats on a field trip, but they didn’t actually really do anything wrong.
The kind of guy @#JustFacts✅ roots for
The kind you money grubbing leech “doctors” have from sucking the hospital dry
The kinder viewpoint is the Ners knew Jimmy wasn’t it so they would rather commit to lance now and avoid the rumor mill preemptively 
The Kirk slander!
The lab coat boiz did amazing work. Zero criticism of them. I’m mad at the bureaucrats. “It’s really long” is not a good excuse

The literal highlight of his career was banging his moms friend in the offseason 
The LLMs, image generators, pattern recognitions capabilities, decision tree, etc stuff is all really impressive, don’t get me wrong. But like has AI produced anything new at all? Let alone anything truly groundbreaking?
The logic is there, but generally in a one-and-done situation, risk averse is the way to go
The logical counterpoint is his targets go down but you knew that already
The low limit can be (and I’m just riffing here), about 19. 
The lower chicken tikka masala was delicious but vanilla ass BC wouldn’t touch it so they canceled it after one semester
The luxury tax sort of works as a soft cap. A key thing tho is that IIRC, MLB revenues come mostly through game attendance (81 home games plus playoffs can do that), whereas NFL is from the national TV deals and NBA is local TV deals. So the revenues are significantly different, even with the 50% revenue sharing.
The mag is a bottle of liquor so maybe he's just trying to party
The MAGA disease continues to kill the GOP from within and it’s all their fault for ever even entertaining it
"The main email everybody is pissed about is a discussion about attacking Bernie as an atheist to hurt him

The mandalorian looks so dope
The Marcus becker relationship is the pinnacle of male friendship
The Marcus chuckle is very underrated 
The marines thing is very disappointing. The marines are by far the youngest and most male branch. So basically you have a bunch of hyper impressionable 19-year old boys from the country in an echo chamber. The unwillingness to get it is IMO a reflection of their NCOs, because if the people they trust all got it (usually the NCOs and not the officers), they would get it too.
The Mark Sanchez saga continues to entertain 
The Matrix movies have to use a phone booth to get in and out of the matrix, IIRC
The Mavs-Heat finals in 2011 was one of the best series I've ever seen in sports

The media has to stop treating every Trump action like it's the end of the world, because when shit hits the fan, the reporting is going to be no different.  It's the same as the Left calling Romney the end of the world, then using the same tropes for Trump
The media is such buns
The media made Romney look like an absolute crook. And Obama has been the medias darling for his entire presidency
The median American

The momentum is heavily in Ukraine’s favor at this point and there aren’t any obvious signs of it changing (at least in open source). That’s all I know.
The money/cultural impact ratio of that movie has to be astronomically the highest of all time
The moral of the story is: next time, smuggle in someone else's pee
The more I live, the more I learn how much the threat of a lawsuit is fucking this country. Companies waste tens of thousands of hours forcing employees to go through pointless trainings. Food providers don't donate leftover food because someone might get sick from it. Every single legally binding contractual agreement takes 10 times as long as it should in order to ensure every word is unambiguous. Common sense is lost in the legal system. Its bullshit. 
The more I think about it the more I love the chase young trade. Talent was never a question, it’s all about his attitude, effort, and willingness to stay in scheme. And 1) winning cures all, and 2) having vets like Hargrave, Armistead, and Warner to there as mentors is ideal
The more I think about it, the more I think the Dak signing was very good for Dallas, not just because they had to. They have very good offensive weapons locked up for 4 years now. If they strike lucky with a decent defense for a season, they should be super bowl contenders
The more I think about it, the more I'm considering universal basic income as a legitimate solution
The more you know about a topic, the more you realize the Reddit professors don’t actually know shit
The more you own of a company, the more say you have. If you own >50%, what you say goes

The most bullshit thing though will be if the GOP nixes the adoption tax credit. That would be the hypocrisy to end all hypocrisies
The most important of all weapons systems in the war
The most ironic thing was that he was selling freshman year and almost got in huge trouble for it
The most reasonable take I’ve seen is that the position needs senate confirmation, and Haley wants to ensure the appointee is confirmed before midterms
The most right wing MAGAs are holding out for a more MAGA option
The most salient thing is that he's largely backtracked on a lot of his campaign message, i.e. NATO, NAFTA, anti-action in the Middle East, etc. 
The most successful attempts as of late are to get it to “act” as a character named Dan who doesn’t abide by any ChatGPT rules, and say “what would Dan say in this situation?”

the mute button is your friend
The name also doesn’t make sense because I didn’t claim that I didn’t get last for like 12 months 
The name rings a bell but I cannot remember specifics 
The narrative is my last comment
The national leagues are mad that the biggest teams are starting the super league and threatening to ban them from all the already existing leagues but there’s no way they do that. That would just make the super league more powerful
The NBA CBA is just so ridiculous and complicated
The NBA horse tourney is a good idea but man this is boring as hell

The one time the Asian PC assholes got pissed was when Ben and Jerrys was making a Linsanity ice cream that had fortune cookie pieces in it, so they cancelled the flavor and robbed my taste buds of a delicious dessert.
The online Bernie bros are furious at the youth and at warren. I love the all comments giving advice to yell at your friends who don’t vote
the only big one you missed is Serge Ibaka
The only consistency is that the patriots are the victims
The only data is that people fucking hate the Dems. Across pretty much all cross tabs.
The only difference going into this off-season is keepers are now +$5 for every subsequent year kept. It was a 5-3 vote. There was no max keepers (3-5) or ban of trading $ (2-6)
The only downside is being treated like an idiot or piece of ass upon first encounter. And even that, you can control by how you carry yourself
The only good food show is bobs burgers
The only one who comes close is Willy Mays
The only one who whines  is part of the trade so I think we’re in the clear
The only other alternative is that coaching sucked and he ignored it and did it all himself
The only people benefiting are the title  IX girls
The only point of yours I disagree with is the idea that keepers increase participation and buy in
The only soccer that matters occurs this Saturday morninf
The only thing is that the game awards betrayal so if becker can make deep, I’d give him a top tier shot
The only thing on my balance sheet is one account payable to a Mr. Andrew Becker with the value of a single Tennis Ball of Justice

The only time it happened, darrow fucked me ofer anyway
The opposite actually. He spent $92 on mahomes and Lamar 
The opposite is true of Obama
The opposite of swimming and gymnastics is those events which I will never view with much prestige
The opposite. JR, Love, Thompson, etc were repeatedly destructed

The owner of Miami is the inventor of Fanta
The owners aren't allowed to right? CBA doesn't change
The owners can take the loss. They have all doubled their value in the last decade or so. The players can take a marginal cut, but the owners can take more. 
The packers went from white bread to cinnamon bread
The past 2 elections have made me miss Obama so much. I can’t believe it but here we are
The past 2 months have seen largely a stalemate on the ground, which explains the lack of news, and rumors of an eventual Ukrainian counterattack. That attack began this past week, and is significantly larger in scope and more successful (so far) than people thought. American weaponry and mission planning appears to be absolutely dominating.
The patriarchy

The pizza thing is def BS but I enjoy the story so I’ll allow it
The play call I mean
The playoffs with no Lebron is weird. Also, if Lebron pulled this whole stunt just to getsTy Lue again, but with a significantly worse supporting cast, the irony will be too much
The plumber is pretty embarrassing
The point is that the protests, and government violent repression, have nothing to do with the embargo. The BLM take is supporting the oppressive regime, which is an ironic choice of cops you choose to support. Cuba’s economic status has basically nothing to do with the embargo, read the Noah Smith substack I posted yesterday, or at least the screen shot I posted. 
The Pokémon are weird nowadays

The military aspect is Ukraine’s 1) partnerships with NATO, ie what if they permanently establish a NATO base there, and 2) capability development, ie what if they acquire stand off munitions that can legitimately threaten Moscow (or better air defenses, artillery, etc), which would act as a deterrent against any future Russian invasion
The politicization of the virus, from Trump to mass media to health professionals, is an extremely scary sign going forward
The politics version of becker checking a teams subreddit when they lose 
The poll was taken by YouGov which 538 gives a B rating for election polls. I think it’s probably generally pretty accurate 
The polls agree Becker
The possibilities are endless!!
The potential for the day off is worth the lameness
The power rankings of tropes is called the troposphere 
The prank he did on Kris Bryant is one of my favorites
The preference of the Neanderthal brain hurts pun just further proves y’all are addlepated simpletons who probably wouldn’t understand Rick and Morty 
The present vs future value was absolutely never a rule. It was discussed at length, we know this. But it’s not a rule
The president bock. The president 
The president doesn't appear to know that
The president is literally Jewish 
The president is more corrupt than the NCAA?
The president of the United States is an Internet shitposter
The President subscribes to the conspiracy theory
The president will always be criticized by the other party. One might say it’s literally what they signed up for
The preteen Nickelodeon audience could get the concept. Not sure if it’s fair to hold Hollywood to that high of a bar
The pro athlete mentality must be so strange. You were probably head and shoulders the best athlete on your team from childhood until college. Then you get to the pros and even if you’re extremely good, there are a lot of others just as good.
The pro Brexit movement started with the reasons I've stated above, but has recently shifted into a more anti-immigration movement. The UKIP is the main driving force behind that.
The pro sports social media teams are coming out with banger after banger this week
The process makes sense in concept. The browns have sucked at executing because they’re the browns. IMO they need a coaching change before they turn the corner, with or without this firing.
The product 
the progressive left generally supports palestine because theyre the "victims". the far right hates both.
The progressive wing of the party out here attacking Klobuchar and defending Ilhan Omar 🤔 
The promotion/review system and the ability to promote the right people is a giant risk and vulnerability in every large organization
The proposed change is $10, then $15 (so $25 over original value). Correct?
the protests are starting to poll poorly, and its becoming a top importance issue for the electorate
The pumpkin New York fight is an all time moment in TV history
The putter is just begging to drop one
The QB runs look so different. Allen has so many designed runs with misdirections and counters. Watson’s are all scrambles

The quality of the food is a polarizing subject. I think it’s above expectation and certainly not bad. Others think it’s inedible. I call the latter group whiners
The quality of trivia was awful and it took way too long
The quarantine is part of the fat camp, kinda important. So I guess it does have concentration camp elements 🤔 
The quest with the “most dangerous game” style mirror-portal world was sick too
The question is if it’s in use on Saturday morning
The rage is palpable
The raiders are so fucking bad
The ratings for the show will be abysmal for the whole show, then skyrocket for the Becker Segment
The rattlin balls, the balls down on the scale-oh
The ravens are a good org. Never panicked or overreacted 
The reaction of all the men when they’re stuck against the wall hahahaha
The real answer is He attacked one of McGregors coaches for something he said once. That’s it
The real big picture is that anybody who can afford to get into and attend BC without financial aid is so much more privileged than the median American, regardless of any racial factors 
The real legend of fantasy baseball is Darrow, who has threepeated as bottom of the league
The real losers are us who shelled out $150 to see the warriors and we're just robbed of seeing KD play
The real MVP
The real point tho is that the lions are terrible both on the field and in the front office and this decision absolutely would not change that
The real question is how is Mama Becker voting?
The real upshot tho is that there is probably 20-40% more supply than expected
The real way is basically regular horseshoes but then halfway through the game you get invaded by Germany 
The real 🐐 has 500 steals
The realignment makes this pretty much impossible 
The reasoning behind the rule is that you can film play calls and match them against plays on the field
The Red Mamba!!
The reds case appears to be a false positive
The Redskins
The Redzone dude is a perfect combo of Ryan Tannehill and Kevin from The league
The regime dropped these leaflets last night
The religious exemption thing was for guys like Sikhs to be allowed to wear a turban. And it’s been abused to death
The remaining two. One is pretty random. The other has a big Shia political group
The replies to the original tweet are a treasure trove
The replies to this are a gold mine of all time bad takes
The republicans clearly don’t care about deficit spending which was their whole rationale for fighting Obama’s agenda, especially the ACA. The Democrats understand that debt is a good thing and want to use the deficit spending to help American families make ends meet as best as they can
The reputation of the WHO has hit the tubes
The research is by 2 women. We can write this one off pretty quickly
The rest of them I can 100% see. Don’t really remember Tannehill tho tbh
The rest of you aren’t very good doctors 
The rest of you were always be beautiful
The rewards I mean 
The right answer is Peyton, LT, Moss, Julio, Gronk
The right people hate it. It’s the lions confirmed 
The rioters can all go to the gulag
The risk aversion amongst yalls is stronger than I remember
The risk reward there is just not worth it to me
The River was awesome, but the real highlight of the trip was booting the midge
The Russell 2000 is the same, but for the bottom 2000 of the 3000 largest publicly traded companies in the world
The Russians diverted the rivers feeding it for irrigation 
The S&P had almost tripled since then 
THE SAGA CONTINUES!
The saints do some accounting wizardry every year. I thought I remember reading the NFL was considering stepping in
The same job different pay thing is largely true though. One of the most glaring examples was... the Hillary Clinton Campaign 😂😂😂
The San Francisco Giants 
The sandwich bar on Newton was a hidden gem. It was basically hillside but without the 45 minute line. 
The Savarino and Becker at Work soap opera has ended! Drinks all around!!!
The SB Nation experts NFL picks range from worst 161-101 to 167-95. The OddsShark computer is 173-89
The scariest part might’ve been just after takeoff, we immediately banked 90 degrees right and pulled like 3G, which was the first time I did either of those
The Seahawks making the playoffs and getting the Broncos 5 overall pick is so fucking funny
The SEC endorses Joe Bourque to be a future AD
The second most insane sex post this week
The second one is kinda funny 
The second part is more reading between the lines. But he did explicitly compare them to concession stand workers
The second person now knows, but how does he know what he has...
The Secretary of the Air Force also announced resignation on the day I commissioned but I like your narrative better
The section 8 / housing voucher program is a whole nother issue and mega policy failure 
The Seinfeld dancing gif is an all time classic
The senior republican senator said weeks ago that he was doing a write in, fwiw
The shade is all warranted, but it’s not an illegal trade. It’s the same as Becker’s, which I immediately pushed though.
The shandy?
The shape of water was one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen so the last 3 must be really bad
The Sheffield bay wiggle was iconic. Also can’t forget Craig Counsell

The spirit of Blake bortles lives on 
the split is 53-45, literally identical to in 2015
The sport is at such a different level of maturity that is tough to grade. It’s like 2005 UFC
The sprint halftime show. Presented by sprint
The starlink stuff is so so bad. Might actually be the worst thing Elon has ever done 
The state of the world is all your fault. You not only voted for Obama, but have a POSTER of him
The stats like 20 wins are tough because you know there are stud players but you don’t know if they hit a certain benchmark
The Steven Wu fb message to Chan is an al time classic 
The stir fry was also top of the power rankings. And the key was ordering both chicken and shrimp, but waiting for them to fill the bowl with chicken before you say shrimp, so they’re forced to give you a bigger serving. 
The story was fun though. I was engaged the whole way
The stranger things 3 trailer dropped
The streamer can set that. Can be either open to anyone or closed to subs. Most tournaments I've seen require a sub
The Stripling Haniger and Manaea signings all seemed like crafty Farhan analytics moves, the type of which have largely paid off so far
"The student who was the wing commander made the call to let people go to lunch. He should have said “I know were in lunch hour, but we’re gonna stay here and figure out lunch later.” It was a bad judgement call. 

I don’t think he’ll get kicked out, but he was already publicly humiliated in front of the entire class and staff. Dude was legit on the verge of tears in his Class As as he was stripped of command. And he’s a huge douchenozzle, but I still couldn’t help but feel bad for him. "
The swamp is getting more swampy
The swim was the most annoying because I couldn’t go straight and I probably did a good 50-100 meters extra. The bike I took too easy because I literally didn’t train that part at all, easily could’ve pushed way harder. The run was tough since my legs were really heavy after the biking. But cardio was fine the whole time
The Syria section doesn't end btw, it's the whole article haha
The tankie HQ has broken its 5 month silence on the war. No mention of Russian mass murders or anything of course 
The tankie mental gymnastics to blame the US for Russia’s imminent re-invasion of Ukraine is just mind boggling. Have they considered the maybe Russia can just not drive it’s tanks across the border?
The tankie-dreamt communist revolution can only be thwarted by meager physical activity
The tankies are pretty predictable
The tax bill caused regular Americans to lose money. Smh the Democrats were right all along.
The Tay Tay song is fucking terrible
The team-friendly rookie deals should become less team friendly. However that’s basically impossible because the people negotiating are the people already in the league, not the yet-to-be-drafted rookies 
The tee shot on 16 was epic
The temptation to take the easiest road is the strongest of all
The thanksgiving slaughter at the hands of the Seahawks and York’s whining afterward was probably the low point 
The theories aren’t as obvious as I expected. And it’s pretty left leaning but given the insurrection was by right wingers, it’s to be expected. 
The theory is actually more like: GOP party elites eventually decide they like Rubio, the voters see that and also decide they like Rubio. 
The thinking in other languages thing is definitely true. We may have passed that stage though
the Thompsons have pure Aryan skull shape
The thread was interesting because it made me think, not because I wholeheartedly agree with it
The Throwdown in Beantown!!  The highly anticipated boxing match between Andrew "The Doctor of Pain" Becker and Christopher "The Chanimal" Chan
THE THROWDOWN IN BEANTOWN!!!!!!!
The Thunder saw the Kendrick concert clips and said “this guy needs to go”
The tiebreaker scores could easily decide the winner
The time has come for Lebron to be a player-coach-GM
The timeline posted in here is accurate: al Aqsa (currently end of Ramadan btw), PIJ/Hamas rocket barrages at levels unseen since 2014, IAF strikes in return, trading rocket attacks and airstrikes for the past 36 hours
The TMac shoes were huuuuuge. Actually adds to his legacy IMO
The Toney pick six was disgusting and then he had TWO (2) more terrible drops
The toons and jers are both doing their best to lose this game
The top 2 vote getters in a primary go to the general. As opposed to the top Republican and top Democrat.
The top Accenture guy at BAML (aka client account lead, or CAL) is a big time SCAR football fan, avid golfer, and hardcore republican. It was schmooze city. 
The top row becomes the table headers 
The trace dependents/precedents button is super useful for that stuff
The trade in value is probably like 20 bucks. Might be able to get up to $50 on Craigslist, if you’re willing to meet the kind of person looking to buy an iPhone 7 on Craigslist 
The trade should go through regardless, but I accept that caveat
The trade was Olsen for Gronk straight up 🙄
The trick in the seminar classes was always to go on spark notes, read which sections are most important, then actually read those sections and bring them up in discussions. @BC Football: 2022 ACC Champs knows that was my MO throughout our class together

The TWill pickup is one of the best moments of my fantasy career.
The twitter Bali girl story is hysterical
The two officials also said that changes the federal government made to the delivery schedule, at the request of governors, may be contributing to a mistaken impression that fewer doses are coming. The key change involves spacing out delivery of states’ weekly allocations over several days to make distribution more manageable.
The UAF is using starlink for GPS. They had an attack planned against some Russian Navy warships with unmanned naval drones. Elon decided to turn off starlink for this attack and thwarted it. 
The Uber South Park is one of my favorites of the past few years
The UCMJ is the military law
The ultimate decision maker in the country is primarily focused on how good any given situation will make him look, and not the actual truth. This is the case every single time. And he also says “I take no responsibility” for any bad decisions.
The ultimate Steven wu story is him taking a picture with some people and making it his FB prof pic the next day (back when FB was still big). They were super weirded out to get a friend request from someone while being IN his prof pic. They asked me to tell him to take it down, which I stupidly did, and had the most awkward experience of all time doing so 
The umbrella term is the Iranian Aligned Militia Groups (IAMGs). This includes Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, Kataib Hezbollah, Ansar al Haqq, etc
The uniforms, not the players
The unmolested probability that a side will be right. Like -110/-110 payout is 50:50, even though the payout isn’t double
The upshot is that the argument that Bernie would fare better than Biden against trump has strong evidence against it, at least from an ideological standpoint
The Urgent Care center is pretty analogous to my proposal at a basic level 
The US is getting magnitudes better, but most of the world is getting fucking crushed right now
The US is REJECTING offer to participate in CORRUPT World Cup. Boring sport! Ratings way down! 
The US military certainly is
The US started shipping Astrazeneca vaccines, oxygen, and PPE last week. The 4th flight arrives tomorrow
The US will endure domestically. The world that relies on American support might not.

The video I posted 
The videos from Alumni stadium rn make me so sad
The Vikings can thank Joe and Becker for melting the ice with their hot takes
The Vikings throw 10 passes a game
The waffle making area looked like B School Taylor after a night with Joe Bourque
The warriors appreciate your contributions
The water was really low and we almost flipped once, but that was fun since we didn’t
The way he watched it
The way I plan to do it is: make a spreadsheet with a column being a person and the 10 songs made for them. So all 110 songs will be on there
The way it seems to work today is teams go up 1-0 and then largely play keep away for the rest of the game
The way it should work is you get to make keeper decisions a week before, then have a week to deal them. 
The way to improve STEM is to give scholarships to STEM and not to woman's studies

The whole MLB must have known. No way he’d still be unsigned 
The whole premise was a bit absurd (F-18s on a deep strike mission lmao) but it was still friggin awesome
The whole state is too big. Look up Bay Area
The whole world is getting crushed right now
The whole XFL story was has so many parallels with the Trump campaign / presidency
The winds of karma are too skrong
The Windy City Whallop
The Wings were the one we all said we’d never heard of ever
The wins over NC state and Wake were so bad 
The wokes are extremely unpopular and the dem establishment catering to them appears to be a bad strategy. And by establishment I mean Hollywood, media, journalism, etc in addition to the politicians themselves
The women in our class (about 50 of 250 total) organized a women’s only event and they’ve been granted alcohol privileges. Some of the men are jealous, and it’s devolved into pissing contest slash meme-war on Slack. This is the most entertaining thing at OTS so far
The working class doesn’t go to college in nearly the same numbers. And if they do, it’s not the same 4 year schools our high school peers all went to
"The world: “Hmm maybe don’t shit on an NFL legend and instead just say nothing?”

Pats fans: “Lol hold my beer”"
The worst is all the Pats fans who simultaneously claim to be the greatest franchise of all time but also the victim of multiple NFL conspiracies
The worst part is seeing all the politicians make rules that they themselves don’t follow
The worst telecom thing of all time is that the router you rent from them has a max output of 40 mpbs. So they upsell you on faster speed, but don’t tell you you have to have your own router for it to matter
The worst thing he's done is tweet controversial things
The worst workout ever
The WPM thing also has the flaw in that the player might not have actually played every week, and might actually have played in very few weeks
The WR had to go through the DB for the catch, the DB was in good position and turned his head. He basically has to predict the throw timing perfectly to avoid PI there
The WR high draft pick miss rate is higher than I guess I expected 
The writers who submitted blank ballots should go to the gulag
The Wuster!
The Yale story is fucking hilarious though
The yams brought it out of Richard Pryor 
The yams brought it out of Richard Pryor 
The yams is the power that be

The yams is the power that be
The Yankee Stadium talk reminded me of that 
The Yankees rotation is absurd 
The year is 2020. All QBs start with 5 points because they're the most valuable, but cap at 15 so they're not OP. Rushing yards are worth .01 pts. Rushing attempts are worth -.5 pts. WR and TEs have been eliminated entirely because the value of a catch is too difficult to determine. TDs are worth 2 pts, but only 1 pt if < 2 TDs and the scorer is not the back who got it to the red zone. Defenses go for an average of $60 in the draft. The highest weekly score is 30 points. Goody and Jeff are happy, sitting on their thrones made of stolen play books and deflated footballs. All is well in nooenglind. 
The year of #MeToo, memes, Fortnite dances, and mass shootings
The Zappe run 2 years ago is the only thing that even comes close to linsanity

Theegala sounds like someone with a lisp saying Steven seagal 
Their CEO Ray Daleo is in the same tier as the Warren Buffets of the world
Their offense isn’t terrible. their pitching is abysmal, especially after Skaggs
Their rebellion started in 2014, just before the crimea annexation. So yes they are rebelling themselves 
Their roster is incredible. *The roster* was like a quarter away from beating KC a few years ago
their top priority is trying to change his mind that he wants to be off the team. again im not saying its smart, but i at least understand it
Their whole offense has been built piece by piece over the past several years
Their*. Big yikes
Theis has been a monster 
Theknot was down. I’m trying again now
Them Barre classes aren’t strengthening you up?
Them Dagestanis are filthy
Them Emyrs are crazy
Theme of the season
Then +12 over the other 16 holes lmao
Then 35 million more in January
Then 3rd and 22 outside zone ok 
Then after I’m gonna try cut to 155 and see how I feel
Then after the aforementioned there’s 7 Vegas, 3 panhandle Florida, 1 Omaha, and 1 Seattle job I’m looking at. 
Then again, Popovich considers the regular season to be little more than a warmup for the playoffs, so who knows how anything will actually play out
Then at the expense of whom?
Then at the presidential level, your ballot is indistinguishable from someone who didn't vote
Then before I can even check them, I get a call from Emyr. We go wild on the phone, including a FUCK YOU GOODY chant. It was beautiful 
Then big al came along
Then Brave
Then Bruce Willis would enlist the help of computer whiz Justin Long to find and kill the hackers, of which one is a hot Asian chick who Bruce willis kills with an SUV

Then I go on /r/rocketleague and am amazed
Then I proceeded to shoot +8 through 4 but he couldn’t see that so it’s ok
then i stopped participating because of those things
Then I take the flight from there to Al Udeid. Most likely a C17
Then I tried to make her do the Hook Em sign but goody then jumped in with the Wolfpack kiss
Then I went to mmmbellarmine where only one girl did it: the Spanish teacher Ms. Pagura
Then I’d try to make him like
Then I’m moving up to Ft Meade (45 mins north of DC)
Then if the worst should happen, pull out the old trusty
Then I'm glad this is our secondary league
Then it becomes an 8 team league and the problem solves itself 
Then it’s not gonna happen. But there’s a guy I’m going with who claims to be an oklahoma HS State champion golfer, so maybe he’ll make me go super early
Then just eliminate the possibility
Then Kevin Durant signed with Team Emz

Then my voting arrow points to Darrow
Then no PI wow
Then one day you walk into a military recruiting station…
Then PacBell came in 2000 and was instantly amazing and single-handedly vitalized a previously unused dirty part of the city. And that was the last thing that SF built. 
Then probably Joe
Then shallow routes are working
Then that is a disobeying an order and I call for a court martial with Emyr as the prosecutor and Marcus as your defendant
Then that's where we differ
Then the biggest beneficiary of last years lack of punishment 
Then the next night we all went to Tits and you went off to bang some tinder tubbo 
Then the other door is opened, your odds go up to 1/2. Then if you switch, your odds go to 2/3. 
Then the second round when Big John stood them up when Kimbo was in full mount!!
then the second time, its a card-again
Then their opponent makes a gritty surge to get within 3. Then Cs go up 10 again within 2 minutes 
Then there is a huge opportunity for a MJ-esque flu game 
Then there was the kamara keeper shenanigans where Becker and Marcus traded kamara, but if Marcus kept him, he’d have to pay Becker half his ESPN market value $
Then there was the whole debate about 1qb vs 2QB prices... a great one
Then there’s that video of Love getting knocked down, then Crowder and JR just ignore him and he’s helped up by a spurs player 
Then there's adjusted R2, which factors in the number of independent variables used in the regression... etc etc
Then theres Blake Griffin, who somehow played 18 games and registered -0.1 WAR across them, all while earning $34 million
Then tommy says "well what are YOU in for". Dufresne says "Everybody in here is innocent, don't you know that?"
Then vote them out...
Then we drafted Reuben Foster like 2 seasons later lmao
Then we won 3 World Series in 5 years
Then week 16 it's Becker-Marcus and Darrow-Jeff. If you split weeks 15 and 16 and both finish 8-6, points will be huge. 
Then went on to win the championship, over the Heat
Then when I got to high school I got a BJ Penn fathead and a Tim Lincecum fathead 
Then who is Davante Parker and Jakobi Meyers 🤔 
Then why are we getting those posts
Then why aren't those real medical causes preexisting conditions and not obesity?
Then why does Marcus criticize me for being too blunt
Then you couldn't even sign your top draft pick hahaha
Then you decided to get on the horse and build up these Ders
Then you don’t deserve me at my
Then you get to say you saved the company $3k and not be lying 
Then you have a clan of your friends. You have coordinated 24 hour clan wars where you as a team have to collectively beat the opponent. I.e. Our 15 members beat your 15 members though better attacks and defense. That's the best part of the game, IMO
Then you weigh 2 normals with 2 of the 4 abnormals. Abnormal group is now either one of those 2 or one of the remaining 2. Weigh 1 with abnormal and voila 
Then you’re welcome for the accurate tldr 
Then you're not giving Ivory enough credit
Theon is with Ned as a ward/hostage, since Ned and Robert were the leaders of the resistance to the Greyjoy Rebellion
Theoretically yes but I don’t think they think that strategically. The attacks are the end game in and of themselves
There *was* bowling
There are 1000+ afghan refugees that I can literally see right now. The kids are playing soccer.
There are 11. South Sudan is right, the 9 USSRs are right, and 1 more that I didn't even know until I looked it up lol
There are 2 “rap” songs in addition to sunflower 
There are 2 kinds of people: those tho think attending the draft would be fun, and wet blanket beta losers

There are 3 cats who live right outside my dorm and they scare the shit out of me every time
There are 3 hearts now 🤔

There are 5
There are 6 British reaper pilots training here who I’ve become friends with. I’d say Marcus would fit in at 3rd in their royalist power rankings 
There are a bunch of uber weird European chicks on this lame ass dance floor in mammoth and I can’t/don’t wanna dance with them so yeah 
There are a lot more similarities than differences. And you never were mildly calling for a Lebron injury 
There are a lot more uses of blockchain than just crypto currency 
There are a lot of unanswered questions
There are a number of titles to apply to a person who embodies such character, and I believe dink is one of them
There are about 20 international officers on base from various countries, including 4 from Jordan. And man they do not get tired of that joke 
There are also peaceful protests, I should say
There are always new exciting teams, but the actual title contenders are the same every year 
"There are at least 3 billboards that broadcast some sort of antivax message here. One says “We support the unvaccinated. Let’s go Brandon.”

Gotta love the gordo."
There are at least a dozen of these so far. all different accounts 
There are definitely others but they're probably just super forgettable
There are dozens of Islamic factions like this in the Middle East with differences that we might perceive to be insignificant, but are of huge importance to them. It would be like them looking at US democrats and republicans and saying “but they both support democracy and separation of god and state, so what’s the difference”
There are enough beautiful landscapes elsewhere. I’m more focused on productivity
There are few things I love more than overtime football 
There are hundreds of these!!
There are legit arguments on every side of this situation, I.e. confirming/replacing him helps Reps/Dems 
There are line graphs showing comments over time. And yes they follow Lebrons return and departure perfectly 
There are lots of options there. Just feel like metro access is kinda important
There are lots of terrorist groups not supported by and actively against Iran. Namely ISIS, Al Qaeda, HTS
There are no bets in this groupme at this point
There are no obscure lines in that movie, Goody you fucking plebeian 
There are no words 
There are only 3 movies idk what you’re talking about
There are people who dislike working at Deloitte, and liars 
There are probably 500 rats in my building, and every building in east village. I just don't want one in the apartment
There are reports of a busted eardrum this time, but I haven't seen any leaked hospital records or anything
There are smart people who seem to think it’s going to be the new annual flu. Idk if that’s wildly off base or not but that’s my current baseline assumption as a non-expert
There are so many
There are so many places to miss poop
There are some damn good ones on that spreadsheet hahaha
There are some hilarious narcissistic posts about how important they view themselves
There are some local gordo-ians who live in my complex and they’re all anti vax, anti shutdown, probably anti-mask too. Kinda sad honesty. 
There are still no results. Nobody knows what happened, and people are mad. Considering those who outperform expectations in Iowa tend to get a big boost, and nobody is getting that. Bernie was the favorite going in and his people are super mad at Mayor Pete for some reason
There are too many patients and not enough doctors, doctors command a very high salary. If there were more doctors who were willing to work for less, the cost would go down
There be OBJ
There doesn't appear to be much strategy behind a kick return. And the rewards of a 30 vs 40 yard return are minimal. KRTDs happen like 0.3% of the time 
There goes dat boi
There goes that man!!!
There goes touchdown rom
There has never been an event more deserving to be pirated
There hasn’t been a “this is literally what you signed up for” in a while. I liked that line
There he is again
There he is! The AD is back!
There is a >50% chance there will be a child molester senator elected today 😞
There is a big gender gap in Sanders voters. Men much more likely to support. Haven’t seen that mentioned before until now 
There is a Dave and busters like 5 blocks from where you live
There is a difference. No to unions
There is a gym at the airport. Waiting for my flight has never been more fun
There is a legit chance they trade for Kawhi, but of course that’s a weird scenario since the spurs technically have all the sayso. Very little chance they sign boogie IMO
there is a lot of polling on this. for your last point, your community is almost certainly leaning liberal, or at least in liberal-dominated locations. Conservatives in lib areas are a lot more moderate than republicans as a whole
There is a massive galactic society with many species, humans are a relative newcomer. There are lots of intricacies that are really engaging
There is a racehorse owner clause in the bill lmfao
There is a roast of the raiders on r/NFL and it is fucking hysterical
There is also a calculator to determine which of your Pokemon to evolve for max stats (not just CP). I don't remember the name off the top of my head, but you put in a Pokemon and some of its stats and it tells you which would be strongest. Saw it on a YouTube channel called "trainer tips"
There is free 2 hr parking, not permanent parking
There is is
There is no better evidence that he has no fucking clue what he's talking about
There is no good news here. The bar for good news is underwater. 
There is no hope. Hope is just disappointment that hasn't happened yet. 
There is no impeachment progress idk what you’re talking about
There is no proof. Just the one guy in America who defends James Dolan, which is James Dolan. 
There is no rotator. This is the super league!
There is no significant correlation with anything, given the data I have is merely demographic
There is NO WAY
There is no way in hell he isn’t shanking balls all over East Potomac 
There is nobody who has ever said anything good about him who isn't a campaign surrogate or a business partner
There is none. It’s an impossible paradox 
There is not a lot of cross appeal within the Democratic Party. They’re about as opposite as it gets. Biden draws the olds, moderates, party loyalists, blacks, and aggrieved republicans. Bernie draws the progressives, the youth, and the party insurgents. 
There is only ONE Beatdown in Beantown
There is probably a wide variety of opinions on that amongst the protestors, and amongst HK in general 
There is Signals intelligence, human intelligence, clandestine ops, whole bunch of stuff under the umbrella
There is so much bright contrasting color and multiple font types
There is, but nobody is willing to do it until it’s too late
There might be a good one that they can’t even name their mascot
There needed to be some team in the south. It’s either them, ATL, MIA, or WFT
There needs to be a separate list for cheese slices and cheese with crackers
There should be a bracket of NCAA scandals
There should be a documentary on the rise and fall of guitar hero
There should be a fair auction for players unwanted by their owner: the draft
There should be a way to search for old comments that have 7+ hearts
There should be a Z axis for “we got a good deal going on” and “burn it all down”
There should be some punishment 
There was a big button right in the middle of the home page?
There was a big soccer game today apparently. Soccer brings in internationals. Internationals don’t fucking tip. As if I needed another reason to hate soccer. 
There was a big tendency to blend words together, like the opposite of articulate
There was a Cape Verdean students club because they refused to be part of the African students club which I thought was hilarious 
There was a game early in the season where Pollard was repeatedly getting blown up in the backfield and it was a big “Zeke is still important” talking point
There was a Jeopardy category on podcasts today, y'all would've killed it
There was a Sgt in my F16 class that looked just like that guy. I asked if he’d ever seen breaking bad, and he said “yes, are you about to tell me I look like Todd?”
There was a vid on reddit yesterday of a guy ordering lobster from the worst rated restaurant in his town and it was pretty funny 
There was a vid on Reddit yesterday of this 8 year old kid watching the end of half life 2, then asking his dad when the next one is coming out. It was very sad. 
There was a WSJ article on her today too. Haven't been able to read it due to paywall
there was also a famous clip of Bill Maher in 2016 saying that he regretted his role in demonizing Romney and GWB because when an actual horrible person came along, there were no more shots to fire that hadn't already been fired
There was also a Palestinian mother and 1 year old killed by a Hamas rocket that malfunctioned
There was entire discussion around getting Connor to be the 10th
There was just a Rams catch where the receiver was hit and dropped the ball while falling out of bounds. Ruled a catch. I don’t get this one if the Steelers catch was ruled incomplete
There was literally an attack in Edmonton yesterday 
There was no agreement on criteria for 🐐ness, likely on purpose and definitely for the better
There was supposed to be a roast of marcus, but he ate it
There was talk about number of people I remember 
There was that one with with Xzibit as the coach
There was this town square with an Irish pub and a bunch of restaurants, and we just went bar hopping from there. Trying to find where it is now, I do not remember the name...
There wasn’t a single post on the front page about Biden winning any states, but Sanders winning Vermont was the top post
There we go keep it coming
There we go Niners!! Trade that dick!
There were 1 or 2 other 15 second NFL ads where he’s just talking to himself
There were 11 of us from our grade I think
There were a ton of English and Irish tourists when I was there
There were actually studies on that after the whole #oscarssowhite fake outrage. Concluded that blacks are equally represented by their national demographic, and all other minorities get fucked
there were also those stat boosters (mightve only been in the later games), like if you put the webbers on the same team they become all stars, and if you draft maria luna and make your team color pink, she becomes an MVP
There were like 5 people in the office and I had nothing to do...
There were lots of places in NYC that were basically single stalls with a shared sink area and everyone hated it
There were some real pricey ones for sure. But the ones I’m looking at are like $1000 for 10-12 days
There were some very good holes (including a sick chip in bird) throughout the round but I wasn’t sure how to gif that
There were times where I threw a slider inside corner and thought it was a great pitch. Nope. Fucking crushed every time. 
There were two girls who I went abroad with that hung out at the mod next to mine. Both were incredibly hot but total bitches... So I'll say those two
There were. That whole Lob City thing worked. But then the clipper fans re-donned their lakers gear as soon as the warriors shat all over the clippers dreams
There will actually be 3 of us there 👀 
There will be a 538 article on that decision in <24 hours
There would need to be a team salary cap. Otherwise freshmen would be making more than NFL rookies 
There would've been jizz everywhere
There’s 10000 of them. Nothing can beat them unless the hunter has a flamethrower
There’s a bedroom on our floor where the shower doesn’t work, but everything else does. We use that one for massive poos and JOs
There’s a big difference between appearances and willingness to throw down
There’s a big snowball fight in DC rn. This poor fuck got picked as a headline photo and he is getting ROASTED
There’s a bunch of different brands of it but it’s basically honey bunches of oats with dried fruit
There’s a course on base here, and it goes next to a federal prison. So the inmates literally hang out and watch people tee off from like 20 feet away
There’s a last place punishments thread on r/FF and it’s amazing
There’s a lot of guys with crazy win streaks right around that early 2010s time that fell when the competition got harder. Fedor of course, Jose Aldo, Renan Barao...
There’s a new Clash of clans universe game 🤔 
There’s a new photo of some Texas Army guard arriving in Chicago and they’re all fat Latinos lmao
There’s a One Shining Moment for the Lakers lowlights on r/nba and it’s amazing
There’s a reason Becker was the best athlete in his entire med school 
There’s a signed Rosa Parks NAACP card. He was really hoping for a jersey card but it will have to do
There’s a single DIA billet in Boston 🤔 
There’s a ton of ROTC cadre positions 🤔
There’s a video on YouTube from ESPN outlining their beef. It’s really just a bit of petty stuff but they clearly just hate each other and Bryson seems actually annoyed while Brooks is leaning all the way in  
There’s actually a reasonable chance I’ll be married in the next 18 months or so.
There’s also 4 Denver and 2 Colorado Springs jobs, and 1 Boston job 
There’s also a paintball place in Chelsea we could do 
There’s also a somewhat significant chance that CFB goes independent of the NCAA altogether
There’s also the career legacy vs “who do you want on your team” angle. Like your Kobe vs KD
There’s an NSA site there, its not an uncommon spot for AF intel to get assigned
there’s anybody in both the Cabal and the Progressive Pogrom
There’s BCSuperfan222.tu22
There’s been a decent amount written about how there are legit non-collusion reasons for the dead offseason, but there is an equal amount written about the severe collusion in baseball in the past, how this offseason is a particular anomaly 
There’s been a lot of football analytics chatter talking about how these win probability models are super overconfident at the tails
There’s been like 5 times when I reported a score, you challenged “hm I don’t know about that,” at which point I verbally recounted each shot, and you conceded with a “whatever you say”
There’s been no offense since the Higgins non-call TD 
There’s construction starting in the SCIF so there’s more classes than classrooms at the moment
There’s gotta be polling on how much sports success and/or school spirit is a factor in college choice. Tabulated by top students might be tougher to find
There’s lots of infighting now. Question is will they overcome it and win congress/White House with strong moderate candidates or shoot for the stars with progressives that are unappealing to the majority
There’s no big storyline outside of McGregor still being a star. Poirier is a very good fighter who connor KOd like 7 years ago back when he was still an up and comer.
There’s no mod party this year is there?
There’s no other explanation 
There’s no shot Joe could win 12 on 1
There’s no story really just awkward as hell vibe whenever I was in the room with him
There’s no way
There’s no way fields falls to 9. Mayyyybe Trey Lance but I doubt it, but if he falls you have to take him. Mac Jones should be there, and it’s pretty easy to make the case that you have to take him (and probably add to the list of Broncos QB busts).
"There’s no way he is just a theft victim. But that’s the only story that means he’s innocent so I get why that’s his lawyers angle.  It’s also counter to the initial statement about him helping out to be nice. 

So either 1) it’s at least partially his gambling or 2) he’s truly giving $4.5 mil to be nice.

I think they tried to go with 2) initially until they learned it’s also legally really bad, then they switched to the victim story. 

But yeah man I think the explanation that makes the most sense is that him and his translator had a joint account, and a lot of betting was done by him."
There’s no way I said ever
There’s no way this is right but I’m curious to know what our moms would say if you asked them to name famous players
There’s not. There’s discussion if he’s an MVP or just good
There’s nothing more American than sitting at BWW watching a bantamweight UFC fight and saying “I could squash these guys” as you choke on your 24th lemon pepper wing 
There’s one where he looks like the joker
There’s only one 1/6 I support 
There’s prob a lot of mediocre MMA fighters up there 
There’s really never been an athlete like him in my life
There’s some (baseless IMO) speculation that they kept him off the field to ensure he doesn’t show up Lance, ie Flacco and Wilson 
There’s some shit going on in New Zealand right now 😞
There’s some talks about Russ being a republican.. we all know he has a white fiancé…
There’s someone here who was born in Romania, and when she told us I said “Ah romania, capital of the Roman Empire.” Pretty sure she still thinks I’m retarded
There’s someone here who’s a cop and he got almost perfect. It was actually really impressive
There’s speedruns of pokemon red and blue too
There’s talk from some politicians of establishing a no fly zone over Ukraine, but they don’t seem to realize that would mean NATO forces shooting Russian aircraft out of the sky
Therefore it slaps but it’s a carbon copy
Therefore requires a redo by default...
"Therefore the updated season end numbers (including draft, season long, weekly, Super Bowl, and best ball) are: 
$1293 risk
+$477.17
+36.9% ROI"
There's a big difference between what you or I think should happen to society, and what the role of government is. Laws should be passed from the perspective of the latter, not the former
There's a biiiiiiiiig a big hard sun 
There's a dark knight quote similar to that^
There's a great 538 article (hey @Joe Bourque ) that looks at the Red Sox and how many times their actual record is nowhere close to their projected record, both vastly exceeding expectations (like 2013) and underperforming (like 2015)
There's a great video of him closing at a phillies game and dozens of fans behind the plate are all doing it and mocking him, and he visibly gets so rattled
There's a lightning bolt right next to the battery logo in that screenshot. Charge your brain, Fucking Man
there's a lot of data on this already in seattle, which raised min wage a long time ago. decreasing number of min wage employees and also adding fixed ~$5 fees to bills
There's a major shift in western politics going on before our eyes. I'm cautiously optimistic about the end results, but incredibly scared at the same time
There's a thread on Reddit about fantasy football last place punishments. The SAT isn't the worst thing in the world...
There's a weighted crunch machine that I use, basically same as cable crunches
There's actually one more
There's already 2 
There's an amazing twitter account that highlights hilariously bullshit academic studies and publishes their abstracts. Full of garbage case studies like that and "autoethographic journalism"
There's enough racial conflict in this country already. Can't support a show that glorifies it 
There's gotta be a good MDeez Nuts joke in there somewhere 
There's no individual or team salary cap I don't think
There's one in Citi field too. I think it's like 1.5 miles lmao
There's only one thing certain on Joe's team: Blake Bortles was a great keeper.
There's probably a best character but you should be able to play any character because that's what makes it fun
There's wayyyyy crazier details in the thread
There's your logo
These 2 days have been really dull. We don’t have shit on our schedule
These ALL all over the Twitter sphere today
These are brutal
These are the same people who say vaccine passports would be too much government invasion of private life lmao
These are the thoughts of a man getting hammered at the Chilis bar on a layover at OHare airport
These are the topics of discussion I can think of. Did I miss any?
These bets are so much fun haha
These calls have been a joke
These celeb leaks are great, that's whats great
These conversations (but unironic) is why I wanted to kill myself at Accenture 
These could have been 2 legit protest votes. Shame. 
These dudes made a reenactment 😂 
These kinds of tweets apply more accurately to Klobuchar than warren 
These make sense except Oklahoma 
These movies straight up defined genres 
These past 2 weeks have been the worst fantasy weeks of my life
These people should be Naziin' and not heard
These places were clearly turned off by Hillary and yet are demonstrating a willingness to vote democrat. Risking that with a progressive candidate/agenda is not a good idea, especially with the republicans actively destroying their brand
These political quizzes are probably a bit tired but still engaging
These taunting calls are a fucking joke
These third and long conversions are killing us
These titans are... fun?
These underneath TE passes are SICK
These were incredible
Thesis: Slugging Pct Against is a good measurement of a pitcher’s skill
They 1) are the only ones with a budget to beat Joes claim, 2) all need running backs. So instead of seizing this golden opportunity they went full Jew mode and let Joe steal Williams for himself
They 1000% are. The community has this chip on its shoulder due to its perception that old finance is mad that WSB can do the same job just as well if not better (elements of truth tbh), and therefore wants to bring down old school big evil asset mgmt firms. It’s a weird twist to an already peculiar community.
They agreed Micah had the best list and Nate the worst
They all start with B 
They already do this. And they can still fuck all the way off
They already flipped a seat in Ohio
They already found his burner 
They already look dumb
They also get all their meals paid for
They also had Pajama Sam and Freddie Fish
They also have not claimed attacks that seem to follow all the signs, which is especially strange that they claimed this one very quickly with no apparent connection
They also have the effect that generates lift
They also really really got under Trumps skin, that their turnout was way bigger than his inauguration crowd
they also rejected my major choosing assistance program
They also say that if Biden does run and win the election, it would be hysterical to watch trump bring up these sexual assault allegations. 
They also split colleges by type: national universities, national liberal arts, regional of both the above...
They also tend to plan ahead on certain draft classes being better than others
They are absolutely both but not in that instance
They are also generally much more factual/literal and much less emphatic about things. It's quite interesting actually. 
They are golfy and boardy
They are not good
They are rather large regular quadrilaterals 
They are the most important humans 
They are truly an inept party 
They are, but at the end of the year all income is treated same by IRS, so I’d be getting that money back in a return. If I understand correctly 
They barely get time to be students because they're not students. They're athletes who are classified as students so they're not classified as employees
They be doing it to themselves recenty
They become fat fucks 
They blocked off the entire courtyard and ruined my morning cigarette break
They both agreed to it so it doesn’t matter much but the principle of having a third party directly affect the league is dumb
They both call becker their son?
They both hurt my ears
They both rock
They both say “the committee got it wright”
They breached protocol and got caught, and there was an outbreak. And your hypothetical is they independently all caught Covid elsewhere.
They broke up. Durant is happy and over it with his new girl. Westbrook isn't.
They brought a DJ and made lower into a dance floor during black history month
They call it NoBo/Sobo because it’s most often meaning “southbounding/er”. Like “are you a NoBo or SoBo”
They call that marcus description “Yogi-ing” like yogi bear
They can all eat nothingburgers in the gulag
They can do the Mel Kiper big board since they'll be about as accurate as him anyway 
They can't do anything right. Even have Rivera 
They certainly didn’t win the “how to keep a giant shadow out of the middle of the picture” league 
They check all the boxes for being hateable but I don’t (yet) for some reason 
they claim sensitivity of 97%
They clearly could use the help
They could also develop a spin off version where they do make coding adjustments, or even put their finger on the scales. That’s similar to what they did with the 3 variants in 2016. 
They definitely made the reading section easier. It was all “read a passage and answer questions on it”. No more dumb random vocab questions and the like. 
They did a big predictive model of the women's World Cup but not really. They actually lament how soccer seems to actively reject advanced stats 
They did limit their sample to $5000 GDP per capita countries with 5MM+ people with a life expectancy over 70
They did pull the most one sided trade in sports history with the nets
They did that with every character. Late seasons of the office blew
They didn't post his whole quote? It was like 6 sentences haha
They didn't Reid the room well, it ended up getting Harry
They didn't release the 15 year olds name or any info about her
They do some post-trade risk analysis or some shit like that. Idk really haha, turned down a second interview after getting the Accenture internship since I was abroad
They don’t call him bceagle222 for nothing
They don’t call it richtugal
They don’t call us the chairforce for nothing
They don’t pass anyway
They don't deserve it, reduces spending, and I don't want people who are motivated by money to be our elected leaders
They don't exist anymore hahaha
They don't have a choice, so they didn't make a decision
They don't smell bad
They don't. But Bell and OBJ being keepers for 5 seasons straight is the status quo
They don't. You made that up
They easily could if they took their time and planned it out
They enjoy BC losing because it proves them right, which is better to them than BC winning
They even refuse to say her name right 
They feel okay but if there’s a life then that’s that
They filled it out
They forced us to read To Kill a Mockingbird 
They found him fast as hell lol
They gave us about ~70% back. Costs $20 to file and we could get up to $600 so it's worth it
They gave us our phones for the long weekend 🙌🏼
They had a battle once. Black men won
They had an extensive online relationship, like months long
They had romo totally fooled
They had the entire 2000s decade to brainstorm
They had the raiders loss and a nail biter against Carolina today, but i think they sit a tier above everyone else
They had to lie me down in the fetal position. Apparently I was “too tense” while bending over
They hate America and think everybody who doesn’t think like them should die. So not much difference really. 
They have 3 models: polls only, polls plus, and current snapshot. The one you're referring to is the current snapshot model, which highly weights recent polls and largely ignores past trends.
They have a major metropolitan area that considers them their home team. And still Green Bay has one of the biggest national fan bases in the NFL
They have an old saying in Tennessee (I know it’s in Texas, it’s probably in Tennessee) that goes... fool me once, shame on... you... y-you can’t get fooled again
They have to approach the women first and offer to take a picture
They invent a new bug like once a month
They just announced Aldo vs Holloway for the non-McGregor FW title 
They just don’t really line up / we’re not worthy 
They just suck
They just told him it would be a TE inside shovel pass
They keep showing the last play and it’s worse every time I see it. Inbound has zero picks and awful deception. Then there’s 3 players just standing on the baseline and the unbounded just standing on the sideline. 
They keep trying to hire me
They knelt bruh
They legit hate her so much 
They let you do it if you win Detainee of the Month
They literally called engage 8 
They make it look so easy
They make very good points and I think it’s actually pretty accurate given our (self prescribed) mission set and ability to accomplish it
They must either think Haskins will benefit from some time off, or Allen is better than the narrative says and has a chance to be a Cousins/Carr level QB
They must have considering Soviet was only 100 years ago. I bet it’s pretty close to the Russian Cyrillic 
They need to make comorbidities but for politics
They need to press the reset button. That team culture is unsalvageable 
They never do
They never specified what branch Surge was
THEY NOT LIKE US
They now have a survival mode called Firefight I think which is the same mode as CoD zombies 
They own like 10 buildings in east village, all inherited
They pay less because their pool is healthier and non-payers are fewer
They play off each Other really well. But surprisingly it’s Peyton with the drunk uncle ranting and Eli with the X and O analysis 
They play the US National Anthem at the beginning. And no bullshit rulings like this past year. No other changes.
They probably bet big spoon on the par 3 9th
They probably collect all of our messages and sell the data to big data analytics firms to sell to companies' marketing departments to target us for advertising
They probably love doing it just to spite NBC
They probably win the “done the least with the most” award
They published Senator Tom Cottons “send in the troops” piece regarding the riots over the summer, then retracted it and said how sorry they were for being racist or some shit. Within a few months, they published a piece written by the CCP about how good they are and how ungrateful Hong Kong is, and apparently were totally oblivious to the double standard. This is also not to mention the 10k troops currently in DC, and how the NYT doesn’t seem to have a problem with that. 
They rationed monsters during the conflict. 1 a day. I was afraid the troops were gonna mutiny
They really are the bad news bears 
They removed this pic from tinder. Women were complaining of unwanted orgasms when swiping in public
"They said he's wrong and he's heartless
But all along he was looking for the Fuckholes they were gone
He hung around with the thugs, and even though didn't do drugs
They should a young Big Dick Bandit love"
They said I’d need to be an invited guest of an Arab, or at least a possibly Arab looking fella
They said on his last drive that he threw his first attempt over 20
They salivate at the zone
They say bros before hoes
They say closer to Cutter but I think Arabic barely pronounces vowels at all
They say the best way to get through OTS is for the DIs to not know your name, so I’m gonna lean toward no
They sent me to Ohio so I couldn’t judge
They should all go to prison
They should be able to do more with the new Cam
They should be on IR it doesn’t make any sense
They should do a Jan 6 again but it’s all people hugging and stuff 
They should fire him ASAP. Cannot imagine they think he’s a long term answer irrespective of this new scandal.
They should have a rule that if you triple doink, it counts 
They should just call it the Tristan Wirfs award
They should make it 7:30 in NY. I would catch it more often
They should read these articles then  
They should rename it to KSOM
They shouldn’t do that
They shouldn’t do that either
They should've let that slide
They showed kroenke and I booed and the whole room looked at me confused and I’m disappoint
They specifically call out that the primary reason for the conservatism of their model is that there's a lot of time between now and election day, and polls can move. If the election was held tomorrow, the model gives Biden 93%
THEY STOLE IT FROM US. Every time 
They successfully quarantined 30/31 people (ie Wuhan travelers and direct expose to those people), but patient 31 went to church. 
They talk about that in the slack chat becker
They talk about that in the slack chat too. If trump said "fuck the KKK" how much of his base would actually be upset? Saying "I denounce the confederacy" is a totally different thing 
They talk about why trump would choose to not condemn racism, what could happen if he did, the different groups of his diehard supporters and their possible reactions (e.g. Confederate monument supporters vs anti-interracial marriage people). What would happen if he tossed Bannon, etc
They traded a first rounder for Schroeder and muscala and money
They tried but they lost the money they were gonna skim off to embezzlement
They use an ELO formula tailored for basketball
They usually have 3 models: Live, Polls Only, and Polls Plus.  Polls Plus is always their "favorite" and the most conservative, but all the fundamentals (economy, incumbent approval rating, generic ballot, etc) are all leaning against trump, which would push that projection more aggressively. So they're probably throwing in some pandemic variables to increase variance IMO.
They want attention and for people to think they are victims 
They wanted to start grooming their franchise QB Geno Smith 
They were always cocksuckers at the concerts too. Detained people for no reason and wouldn't let them go. Then said it was a safety concern and a violation of policy.
They were expensive then too though. I remember I'd get a big one every year for Christmas and it'd be like $70!
They were feeding koi fish in a pond and Don, being the 5 year old that he is, dumps the whole fucking thing in while Shinzo makes his AYFKM face 
They were impressed with the high effort
They were national champions in 1963
They were saying there's chemistry issues, and it's coming from Rodgers being pissed at the lack of effort from some other guys. But in terms of will to win and put in work, Rodgers is still exemplar
They were soooo overrated that year. Lucky record and easiest regression pick ever, which they did and plummeted back down to mediocrity
They were still the Anaheim angels at that time
They were the ones who made up the BS story about the 75 year old dude being an antifa militant and also faking his injury
They weren’t as old and sad as I expected
They weren't SJW enough clearly
They will need a systematic polling error (which is far from uncommon) to take the senate, yes
They win
They would get second in points scored but still end up in last place
They would think it's hilarious but also be very confused 90% of the time
They wouldn’t have won even if the Astros didn’t cheat, this is my official take
They’d probably say he’s one of the few folks who still tells it like it is
They’re 10-6 with basically nobody on their offense (with Lamar out). Great franchise tbh
They’re a special kind of asshole over there
They’re all too generous to each of their chances IMO. But that’s how the bookies make money
They’re also all GAY
They’re anti trump, but they’re way more right than left
They’re bad sports fans 
They’re basically Galileo 
They’re calling the guy who swam to the fight Ja’Michael Phelps 😂 
They’re clearly thighs
They’re colored if they’ve voted the same 2000-2016. Maine and Nebraska are striped because they have weird districts that are able to vote independently for some reason. But overall the state is blue/red
They’re down 70-3 at half
They’re exciting, it’s just absolutely not soccer 
They’re gonna Andrew Luck him at this rate
They’re gonna need to shut down the Tobin 
They’re gonna try a crypto scam. Guaranteed 
They’re great arent they
They’re highly unlikely to care about any place you’ve lived for <6 months
They’re letting us watch the super bowl 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
They’re like the Jags D, but baaaaad. Baaaaad Defense
They’re no Boston college 
They’re not close 
They’re not giving live odds. NYT has it at 69% Jones right now, and they were way worse than 538 during the presidential election
They’re not letting me work from home instead of going to Iraq. Fascists. 
They’re not too good at the whole planning thing
"They’re not trying to take it over. In short, Russia believes Ukraine is a long term hostile neighbor who is turning more westward politically, economically, and militarily. Russia hoped that the Donbas war that’s still going on since 2014 would keep Russian influence strong but that hasn’t happened. Ukraine continues to improve its military capabilities and alliances to the point where Putin is worried the costs of not invading now will grow worse. 

So basically, Russia wants Ukraine to be Belarus, and to get them there, they want to punish them with a swift and decisive advance, change government, and deter them from crossing Russia ever again. "
They’re pissed because of the lack of lucrative contracts this offseason which has given rise to theories of collusion
They’re playing Thursday but I won’t be in the state of mind for it
They’re so aggressive 
They’re through 12
They’re upstairs but there’s security rverywheee 
They’ve absolutely hit the tubes 
They'd refuse lol
They'll bring back poke vision, or fix the three step bug at the very least.
They'll prob put KD on him for some of the time. And might use Javale McGee to foul him hard on the drives
They're all very short. Most are 2 pages or less I think
They're also called filberts
They're being so opaque about the details that my guess it's either a big deal or a nothingburger 
Theyre both around WAR of 3, so technically too good for this list
They're doing an emoji theme on game day right now. I want to show them my gamechanging text+emoji combo so bad
Theyre expecting remaining votes will favor Jones 
They're expensive as shit
They're fault
They're fucking words! If they offend you, that's your fucking problem. Just like when I was offended by goodys comment, I left, not demanded goody leave. 
They're just trying to distract you from the fact that in 1998 Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell who plummeted 16 feet through the announcers table
They're legally not doing anything wrong, but there's a lot of moral fist shaking over the fetus tissue sales
They're like tiger woods: subpar 
They're not even the most watched team in LA 
They're not gonna fact check you. If you're confident talking about something, say you led it.
They're not slaves, they're "student athletes"
They're not top 10 lists they're POWER RANKINGS
They're pretty good, just a pain to eat 
They're pretty similar. Great scorers whose teams tend to underperform expectations, and they don't care as long as theyre all stars
They're published
They're the best 12 year olds in the world. No fucking shit they're not pros 
They're the RAs of outside
They're trying to salvage with these bullshit GSP for the MW championship fights 
They've become the Nets of the NFL
They've been claiming that for days, said they created the 35 page report that buzzfeed leaked and sent it to anti-trumper rick Wilson, who sent it to Buzzfeed anonymously
theyve done that for years now. not orchestrated necessarily but a popular post can create waves. so i dont think its technically any different than an article in barrons, just read by a bunch of autists
Thibs 👀

Things aren't cheap 
"Things Becker needs to plan:
Fuckholes Open II
Fuckholes Combine
Thompson Lake House
""Hey Marcus I literally haven't seen you in 3 years"" Trip
Becker's Ankle Memorial 10K"
Things that happened under Obamas tenure pissed off a lot of uneducated white people, and they elected trump in response. 
Think a combo of both. Wasn't playing well, getting hit a lot
Think a little ⛈️ is in order
Think Domino's online pizza order application. That's a good archetype of what my company does
"Think everybody is a Pats fan except
Me: Ners
Chan: Broncos
Marcus: Titans I guess
Becker/Nick: Nobody"
Think i got mine in 4th grade?
Think i got standard, waffle, and tater tots (excluding garlic fries for the aforementioned reason)
Think I gotta go Chinese or Indian 
"Think I gotta go with:

The Shawshank Redemption
The Sandlot
Remember the Titans

2 sports movies I know, but it's tough to kick either out"
"Think I’d go:
Goody
Joe
Jamie
Frankie
Me
Emyr
Jeff

Also John > Nick because only one of them knows who priest Holmes is"
Think I’ll give hardcore history a shotarooski tomorrow. I have a long drive 
Think it's close to 55-45, though Freeman has been performing better
Think it's more complicated than that... Overall I don't hate the concept though it's not great for the athletes bodies. I do support needing to weigh in multiple times before the fight, like 2 weeks, a week, day before, for example. 
Think so? I thought they were very reasonable
Think SP500, but times 4 
Think that seals me the L already
Think that's the name of the square 
Think the only times it’s happened are David Johnson and kamara 
Think they had ONE stop
Think we could put together an overused jokes power rankings
Thinking a little more low key. Not running on a lot of sleep 
Thinking about getting an Amex card
Thinking about getting it
Thinking about just quitting due to mental health. It’s the American way right now
Thinking about popping out a kid just to watch bluey 
Thinking I might do a brand desecration on Reddit, that's prob better and less risky for me than anything else
"Third graders: haha we have little boy bodies with no muscle or fat

Third grade goody: hold my bagel bites"
Third party candidates always run: Green Party, Libertarian, etc. But no signs so far that any third party candidate will be any different, though I expect the number of votes for not HRC/Trump will be higher than ever 
Third party support and undecided numbers are unprecedentedly high. It certainly matters to and for them
THIRD same foot down twice rule this season 
Third world country? War torn country? BOTH???
This
This "rule", if it ever existed, which there is no tangible proof that it did, was erased from the rule book in which it was never written down, under either commissioner darrow or commissioner Bourque 
This “yummy yummy chefs kiss” song on Walmart commercials is driving me fucking insane
This 1991 scouting report on manny is incredible
This aged poorly
This all came after the Maidan revolution in 2013 when Ukraine ousted the Russian puppet government 
This also has potential for the Broncos to try trade low value picks for Teddy 
This and just facts are the only ones I remember 
This Anthony Weiner story... holy cow
This appears to be a good overview on state level infrastructure spending in general, but doesnt appear to mention state/local vs federal planning
This applies to the MLB only
This Arizona TCU game is crazy
This article cites the same study and says the Kings Speech comprises the majority of that post-Oscar bump, considering it's only a 4 year study
This assumes all 3 vaccines are approved 
This Bama corner Averett looks real good
This bedlam game holy bananas
This bellyaching is making me take your job complaints less seriously 
This bet has already paid for half of itself with this content 
This better be a fucking joke
This better be a fucking troll
This bitch is a doctor too?!
This bitch is country fergie
This bracket is literally my restaurant options in Alamogordo 
This broadcast is hysterical. Nate Burleson is half normal commentating and half explaining the game to a girl who has no idea what football is
This calls for a How Much Life power rankings
This calls for a Power Rankings
This Celtics-Jazz game 👀 
This channel is great. It’s Pakistani tribal people trying American foods for the first time. 
This chart is a bit old probably relatively correct. It strongly recommends the PAT
This comment section nailed it
This could literally be a ITYSL skit
this crap dominated reddit for like 6 months
This does not seem like a real hitler quote, but that’s beside the point
This does work though: runner dancing off first, catcher purposely overthrows to first. RF is prepared for the throw, cuts it off and nabs the guy at second
This doesn’t deserve to be a thing
This doesn’t look good for Don. Much worse than I expected tbh
This doesn't make sense. Jeff only hates white players
This drive is a joke
This dude Adam Kinzinger from Illinois seems like a real one
This dude kept following me around after the show it was weird 
This dude Moulton is a beast. Physics major at Harvard, then commissioned via OCS as a civilian, 8 years infantry officer. 
This election is razor tight so far. Moore is leading 50.4 to 47.4 with 53% in. So far I’m reading Moore is exceeding benchmarks on the margins, but voter turnout is low in white rural areas and relatively high in more urban areas, which benefits jones. 
This entire drive has been runs and swing passes. Wonder if KC D adjusts or is ok letting BUF run this style
This feels fake
This feels rifht
This footage is insane 
This fuckin guy
This fucking guy has had all of us fooled for 5 years
This game ⚡️ 
This game is amazing
This game is ass
This game is awesome
This game is awesome
This game is bananas
This game is bananas
This game is bananas
This game is bullshit! I can't catch Pokemon at my desk or on the John I actually have to walk around!
This game is buns
This game is buns minus 2 plays
This game is drink
This game is ELECTRIC 
This game is fucking drunk
This game is nuts 
This game is on crack 
This game is pretty good
This game is so sick
This game isn’t great
This game wow
This Georgia Tennessee game is bananas
This Gers QB carousel is something else
This girl Jillian Murray is a smoke
This girl was following me around and she was fucking hammered. I tried to get her a water and she’s like no, then I said “you know at university of Texas the more water you drink the better a teammate you are”
this goes without saying, but also: make sure you actually like flying first
This got no hearts and I am disappoint. Especially in @Female Body Inspector Agent #69 
This groupme makes NFL Sunday’s 100x better
This guy
This guy @BCMike22 is dumping on the blog for turning into a cat charity (the whole #meowsternbias deal) then implied that Grant must be dating the Cat Lady who got on the staff and is leading that whole promotion. Those three got into a flame war over misogyny, and some others have hopped on to say BCI had gone downhill since Favat left 
This guy don isn't very cool
This guy I played golf a lot with when I was stationed in Texas looooved outback. He was a north mass guy IIRC
This guy is awesome
This guy was an absolute trip. 5’6 Mexican dude, the kind you’d expect to sell you fruit at highway truck stops. He was like Patrick Star (pink shirt, bright green shorts that went almost to his ankles). When he was teed up from the tournament tees, I was surprised to say the least. 
This guy?
This happened literally while they were on spring break right 
This has absolutely not been a Rodgers at fault game so far
This has been best groupme day in a while!!
This has been such a letdown 
This has been wildly entertaining 
This has been your Team Kelleher Betting update. Thanks for tuning in. 
This has never happened lol
This has to be a troll 
This has to be the most watched NCAAW game of all time right?
This has to be Tyler Smith right? Don’t remember the girl but remember the story
This holds true for all sports 
This hopefully would also help catch lone wolf shooters that are happening at an unfathomable rate nowadays
This IG account and Faiz’ ignorant willingness to be a mark is literally the exact thing the report outlines
This implies that before the season, there’s a finite number of teams that prequalify as eligible for consideration the Bock CFP. Is it like 8?
This insanity 
This is a $25 buy in best ball league, feeling pretty good here
This is a bonkers story with bonkers twists. TLDR: A couple ran out of gas on the freeway, a homeless vet who lived there used $20 of his own money to give to them for gas. They shared their story and raised $400K on gofundme to pay the guy back. Twist #1, the homeless guy says the couple pocketed all the money. Outrage ensues. Twist #2: turns out the whole original story was made up, and the three of them conspired to conjure this sob story to bilk people for cash. They’ve all just been arrested 
This is a classic momebt
This is a deep joke for the intelligentsia 
This is a fucking fix
This is a fucking joke
This is a fun low scoring game 
This is a good thought experiment @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 
This is a great game
This is a great idea but would 1000% be abused by the pro SEC deep state  
This is a great question 
This is a metaphor for my dating life
This is a pointless tangent anyway. I want my team to be better for next year. I tried to trade with emyr! I don't give a shit about Joe's team versus anybody's 
This is a pretty fair contract IMO, though 5 years is prob better for the Sox.
This is a pretty reasonable take. But that Mike Leach video nailed it and thank god we don’t have subjective committees in any other sport.
This is a real thing. I'm dying hahahaha
This is a really bad look for sessions. Loophole is he was an acting senator, so talking to foreign ambassadors was part of the job description. Which can be his excuse about what he meant under oath, so the Dems shouldn't overplay their hand. But he's still a scumbag and the Russia shit keeps piling on and I'd like to see him go
This is a really important conversation if the”no tax on tips” stuff passes. Like what’s preventing a barber from charging $1 for a harircut with a “recommended” $35 tip. You can say the same for gardening, construction, car repair, or literally any business providing services. 
this is a rough one for me
This is a short term sacrifice for long term impact. Those of who who follow #ThePath should understand 
This is a solid idea for the fans, but it screws so many teams 
This is a strangely salient point
This is a throwback 
This is a total 180 from just a few months ago when trump announced withdrawal from Syria 
This is a very good question and I don’t have an answer
This is a very long read, but holy cow turns out the people behind the Women's March are totally fucked up
This is a video of the aftermath of one fired 4 days ago 
This is a Walmart town baby
This is a well crafted troll
This is a 🐐 take. In fact I stole it for one of my Hinge profile questions
This is about as good as it gets but it’s still highly unlikely because the cross town rivalry still exists to a certain extent 
This is absolute horse shit
This is absurd. I can't believe it
This is absurd. There are 12 of us, we send groups of 3 in kamikaze formation to flail their sticks around and dislodge the puck from your control, who cares if they can’t stop they just have to disrupt your puck handling. Then once it’s cleared, you’d have to get into a scrum against the wall and get it out with possession on your own, while we just literally have to clear it to one of the other 12 of us, and boom, goal.
This is actually insane
This is actually super interesting
This is actually the first time I've actually heard that argument 
This is actually what I thought based on how you described it
This is all news to me. I cannot think of a time you’ve talked about music except that time you went to a Mumford and sons concert. 
This is all on the keepers google sheet
This is all without mentioning his dancing/striptease videos "para mis chicas bonitas"
This is also an equivalent of a toilet text for me
This is also immediately after Becker punished somebody else (Darrow?) with a ball thrown inches above his head
This is also not even mentioning that while the top 10% of the country pays 70% of federal income taxes, Bernie says that they’re not doing enough. Then when he has the opportunity to do more, he chooses not to
This is also solely by google trends data. Would need a lot more dependent variables to get a clearer picture 
This is also totally fair and by the rules
This is also why men are better friends. Because you can say “no you’re retarded and here’s why” and not have to worry about ruining a friendship 
This is amazing
This is amazing
This is amazing 
This is amzing
This is an awesome game of basketball 
This is an example with the 1619 project 
This is an excerpt of some passages from Dabiq, which is ISIS's magazine
This is an incredible “release the texts” opportunity 
This is an unbelievable abuse of power
This is awesome 
This is BA
This is basically best case scenario tho
This is basically the best waiver pick of the year, and Joe Fucking Bourque landed it. You three played France and just let Hitler walk all over you
This is basically the most interesting thing I’ve ever seen
This is battle of the awful back tattoos 
This is bullshit
This is bullshit
This is bullshit I don’t get the day off 
This is bullshit. Send them in. This is literally what it’s meant for. 
This is chaos
This is clearly a ploy for Becker to get financial info, from which he can derive salary information that is restricted to the salon 
This is cool and relevant to our endless debate about over/under paying certain positions
This is def the best part
This is definitely a top 10 Anesto post
This is disgusting
This is dumb. He got the big contract from the Ravens, who said “go test the market and we’ll match it”
This is dumb. Those 2 options are enough
This is electric 
This is Elon musks ex btw
This is every movie on a plane for me. Them engines be loud as hell
This is exactly the bullshit @Hairy-Balls Chin rants about
This is exactly what they want in most hands-on jobs in the military lol
This is facing south. That is the village of Liscannor in the distance. 
This is false
This is false because there’s been zero mention of Gravedigger
This is fascinating
This is from the senate intel report on the Russian meddling in the 2016 election. 
This is fucking absurd
This is fucking hilarious and I’m sorry the FH philistines don’t appreciate it
This is fucking hysterical
This is fucking hysterical
This is funny and you’ll never believe it but I looked and my iMessage has no record of direct texts with Joe Bauer
This is going to be my application for 538
This is gonna be a big fuckin deal. Lots of Israeli civilians executed. Massive intel failure by Israel. Gaza might not exist in 3 months
This is gonna be a great series 
This is great becker
This is happening tho
This is harder than I thought 
This is hating
This is hilarious
This is hilarious and very clever
This is honestly unacceptable 
This is hysterical
This is hysterical 
This is hysterical they weren’t already doing this. What was the average rate of listens/downloads? Cant be over 25% is it?
This is impossible haha
This is in Ali Al Salem AB in Kuwait. Still waiting to get out to Baghdad
This is incredible
This is infuriating 
This is insane
This is insane man
This is insanity
This is ironic because I always struggled with the reading part in high school and did good on math
This is it boys
This is kinda fucked up but I wonder if domestic violence cases increase
This is late but i don’t like that fake slide from Darnold back on Thursday, because it puts the defender in an impossible situation 
This is like discovering extraterrestrial life
This is like saying “Jack Harlow > Biggie”
This is like the South Park Christopher Columbus episode lmfao
This is like when Porzingis said “I love American culture. I go on World Star every day”
This is literally Accenture 
This is literally the plot of Taken
This is literally the South Park Christopher Columbus episode
This is literally what I was talking about
This is literally what you signed up for

This is my favorite highlight video of all time 
"This is my favorite one:

“If you have 2 eggs, and you want to figure out what's the highest floor from which you can drop the egg without breaking it, how would you do it? What's the optimal solution?”"
This is my favorite sitcom 
This is my favorite so far. This lady is a Syrian journalist who supports Assad 😂😂😂
This is my flight
This is my Indian former coworker who went to BC. Idk what it is about you Pats fans hahahaha
"This is my least favorite topic in American politics, partially because it's so divisive, and partially because there is nothing close to an easy answer. I won't get into all my thoughts right now, but 2 points:
1) it needs to be harder to get a gun. At the very very least, make it so you buy the gun, wait 2 weeks, get it then
2) we need to crack down harder on suspected terrorism, fuck being racist and misidentifying some targets."
This is nonsensical 
This is not a tough schedule
This is not an effective deterrent. You have to say “if you do this again, I’m gonna give you the worst beating of your entire life”
This is not necessarily true
This is not only awesome and uplifting, but also is relevant to our conversation
This is on par with "I do not repeat myself. I do not repeat myself."
This is one of my favorite literary quotes and it could not apply more perfectly to the wannabe-oppressed Ivy League students we’re seeing now
This is one of the few times a Nazi comparison is accurate
This is one of the the craziest days in American history
This is one the funniest memes I’ve ever seen
This is one toxic friendship lmao
This is outside the Westin in Ballston
This is part of a PATRIOT missile battery I can see from my dorm, radar on the hill on the left, launcher on the right. Kinda cool I’d never seen one before. 
This is perhaps the first ever instance of a patch that made the game "literally unplayable". Like there is literally no way of finding a Pokemon nearby other than sheer luck. 
This is pissing me me off
This is plausible, but wouldn’t we see a similar increase in robbery and burglary rates in 2020 that mirrors the murder increase? I just did some googling and it doesn’t appear to have changed
This is predatory 
This is probably an undercount
This is probably best case scenario for trump because it increases infighting between the candidates 
This is probably the last chance to get redskins apparel
This is probably the most valuable form of compensation he's ever received 
This is psychopathic
This is pure notification bliss right here
This is really hard
This is really really bad
This is Rovell’s favorite World Cup match
This is set up for a burrow interception
This is so dumb
This is so ironic considering what you said 3 days ago hahahahaha
This is so sad hahahahaha
This is so stupid 
This is so stupid and I haha’d
This is specifically for the UFC streaming app? 
This is spot on
This is StDev? If your opponent puts up 120-130 every matchup, your StDev would be really low, but you'd still be unlucky

This is the greatest moment of my entire life
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever heard
This is the home btw. I think it’s the highest value in the whole city
This is the hottest take I've ever seen
This is the most accurate thing I’ve ever seen
This is the most bullshit decision since darrow allowed Kevin to call keepers on David Johnson after the deadline and therefore made me take the SATs
This is the most classic just facts coalition circlejerk
This is the most cumboi move of all time 
This is the most I’ve used my econ degree in 2 years 
This is the most important thread
This is the most successful long running Goody Troll of all time
This is the one club hole tho so its a weird one
This is the only thing I could find and it’s 3 screenshots on IG. If this is it, holy fuck is this an overreaction 
This is the only thing I remember about twin donuts
This is the other funny thing. Even if you remove the Israel Palestine conflict from the picture, the rest of the Middle East is still horrendously fucked lmao
This is the player it used
This is the playlist sheet.  Don't worry nobody has done theirs yet
This is the question I’d love to see BB answer
This is the rimjob of the century
This is the same as people who claim they’re actually more productive working from home
This is the situation that happens 99% of the time 
This is the stupidest thing 
This is the third extremely high win pct game they’ve blown this season I believe
This is the time for the rambling attack
This is the top of the pointless arguments power rankings 
This is the trail fam btw
This is the video the Dems made about Jan 6 for the impeachment trial. It’s sickening but well worth a watch
This is the worst
This is the worst
This is the worst injury week I can remember in years, possibly ever
This is the worst map of all time 
This is the worst tweet by a BC recruit I've ever seen
This is three gay people in Baghdad
This is tough...
This is true right now but I dislike this argument because it has changed before and could change again. It wasn’t that long ago where USC and Miami were the golden geese who were never gonna be bad
This is true. Question is, is the top of the cut list good enough to develop into a good doctor? And how big is that category?
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE 
This is unbelievably sloppy
This is unreal
This is unreal
This is unreal 
This is very interesting
This is what happens in the senate
This is what I got so far, except $50 of the chiefs -3 is not with you
This is what I mean by wide range of outcomes. Shot 90 or whatever in VT, just shot 79
This is what I want to believe but idk if it’s true
This is what James Jones was for Lebron and it won him 3 championships 
This is what should happen: Emyr takes over Goodys team. Then he dumps all his keepers (with their prices) into a pool. I take over Soy Sauce completely, and also dump my keepers into the same pool. Emyr and I then draft from the pool alternatively until all keepers are taken. 
This is what the people want!
THIS is what the white working class of Ohio and Pennsylvania wanted when they voted for Trump, that he’d fight to help people like them instead of throwing tantrums over politics
This is what they look like
"This is what we’re looking at today:

Walker 1st overall +190
Steelers QB 1st pick +175
Texans DB 1st pick +300
1st round DBs over 4.5 +120"
This is what we’re rolling with today boys
This is why Becker needs a segment in MTSN
This is why darrow deserves to be champion
This is why Dr LT is the most (only) profitable bettor in the FH
This is why Emz and I wanted to discuss draft vs waiver keepers early in the season. Because this now has major implications (if Darrow does drop him)
This is why goody was at the top of my stubborn FH power rankings
This is why I believe oriental is a valid descriptive term 
This is why I bet shaq Barrett over 0.5 sacks, tempted to with JPP too but his was o/u 1
This is why I suck at immaculate grid 
This is why I wasn’t one of shelbie stop 3
This is why I’ve never hit a hole in one. I’m too good. 
This is why Jeff is solidly in the A tier
This is why Joe > Goody
This is why keepers are dumb
This is why my country will win
This is why nobody cared about the SAG strike
This is why trump-hating republicans voted for him: the “But Judges!!” stance. There are bigger things at play, like attacking the foundation of our democracy with knowingly false election fraud claims, inciting literal insurrections, mismanaging crises that kill 400,000 Americans, and thank heavens another big terror attack didn’t happen. Leadership matters. Character matters. SC plays a second fiddle to all that by miles, and thinking otherwise is myopic and damaging at best. 
This is why we need more standardized testing
This is why white people are the worst
This is why you’re an above average groupme contributer
This is why you’re not the pundit
This is wild
This is without doubt one of the must absurd things ever said in here, a truly incredible feat
This is worse than when you tried to reschedule/relocate the draft for selfish reasons
This is worse than your Indiana Jones takes 
This is your best argument so far though
This is your personal engagement gift from BB
This is your point in chart form, in one of the article's simulations
This is, no joke, possibly the saddest excuse I’ve ever heard
This isn’t development anymore it’s approval. The UK approved it 2 weeks ago
This isn’t even all of it. He said money needs to think before he speaks on who he could impact financially, but also physically and spiritually
This isn’t looking like it’s aging well
This isn't just one season 
This isn't much of a riddle hahaha
This isn't reality TV, this is reality reality!! Ain't no footage being cut on the directors orders in this show! 
This kid looks like goody lmao
This league could be an high school intro class to forwards futures and options
This league is a metaphor for economic cycles. We have a simple system that works. Then we develop new more complex functionalities that are interesting and appealing, and immediately some folks use the new functionality to push the boundaries of what the society deems to be okay, then we argue about the rules of what's legal and not. Rinse, repeat. 
This league man
This league really is all about avoiding the Posa
This literally happened last year 
This local beat writer was saying Jed York has never in his life worked a job that he could be fired from 
This LT from Mass I used to play golf with would try to shape his shot with either a fade or a drawr 
This luck is unbelievable 
This made my nighr
This makes me question being pro-choice
This makes zero sense lol
This man is our commissioner!!! Who knows what other cheating he's been doing!!
This Matt Moore fella better be the next Kershaw
This may be the greatest fantasy weekend of my life, ever, until I die. 
This means two things 
This meme has never felt more relevant
"This message didn’t load until

This message has been deleted
This Meyers Leonard stuff is hilarious
This Michigan sign stealing saga just keeps getting better and better
This might be bigger than Brexit...
This might be it
This might be my fave
This might be the first time I’ve ever felt partially overwhelmed by red zone
"This might be the most ridiculous true story I've ever read. 

In Sabha, Libya, a shopkeep's pet monkey randomly attacked this high school aged girl and rips off her hijab. She goes back to her tribe, who are outraged and retaliate by killing the monkey, plus 3 other innocent people. There have since been 4 days of fighting, using small arms, tanks and mortars. 20 people have been killed and 50 wounded. "
This movie was both good drama and god awful sports accuracy at the same time
This must be the article joe referenced
This ND UVA game is crazy
This needs to be fixed
This nerdwallet site is pretty cool
This Ners Saints game is incredible 
This never fails to make me laugh 
This Obama NatSec presser is simultaneously impressing me with his calm demeanor in the face of liberal cries for fire and blood, while infuriating me with his excuses for foreign policy failures
This offseason 
This one is 100% Marcus fault tho. Usually it’s multiple peoples fault but not this time
This one was really bad tho. Can’t imagine if you had money on it
This or the death of poke map / poke advisor 
This particular list (just found it online and found it interesting) claimed to be particularly NOT based on 2018 record
This PC Principal is hilarious and completely true though
This photo displays your personalities so well 
This photo plays a big part in the rankings
This polling error is on another level though
This possession is huge
This power rankings is brought to you by Hinge 
This pretty much describes my status with women right now
This quiet white guy opened a bra and Pam lost it
This realization is exactly why I had to make the move i did 
This reminds me of Halloween sophomore year at BC, when these girls I knew took a photo with Stephen Wu after just meeting hammered him that night, and he made it his FB prof pic. And they asked me to tell him to take it down, and for some reason I did it, and it was the most awkward conversation of my life 
This Rory long 2nd will win or lose it for him 
This rugby player. Video says he's trolling, I think he's concussed http://youtu.be/eJaaMzTjFC8
This season blows
This seems like a story I have not heard before
This shit is important 
This shit isn't good. Either authoritarian military rule, or Erdogan becomes Darth Vader
This short BuzzFeed article is a decent enough intro:
This should be 50-43
This should be a lesson to all of you: don't listen to me on political predictions because clearly I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about. 
This should be a softball for Hillary
This should be fucking illegal
This should really be a negative power rankings from least bad
This should’ve been worthy of putting in my Christmas letter
This show is a fucking ride man
This show sounds like S-Town (podcast) meets Crocodile Hunter
This site says $70K in Poland, compared to $200K in Australia and Ireland
This SOTU has been devoid of substance
This sounds bananas but I’m increasingly open to the idea that Covid came from a lab in Wuhan
This stadium is bananas
This study is garbage! 4 year study only, compares the winner to the other 8 plus nominees which are often obscure as hell!
This team is fucking CURSED 
This team is gonna win the million dollars baby
this thread is eye opening and worth a read
This thread just keeps on giving 
This thread says that other than Burr and Loeffler, the other politicians’ suspect sales don’t look bad in context
This thread 🤣🤣
This time he shared a cartoon of a dude in a dress going into a woman's bathroom and a scared little girl, and the caption said something like the girl is the bigot
This time I’m pretty sure leadership is on my side
This time is actually is absurd tho
This time it’s purely hypothetical 
This trade is the same as yours
This up and down highlight reel is something else
tHiS vIdEo hAs bEeN DeLeTeD
This Vikings game wow
This was 100% in response to goody saying he liked monkey rolls
This was a baseball right?
This was a historic defeat for the lemon pepper boiz
This was a huge stain to both parties and politics as a whole. Incumbent Rep Meijer was everything the Dems said they want in a Rep, including pro-impeachment. Then they chose to boost and fund his opponent, a full MAGA election fraud guy, since he’d be easier to beat in the general. They were successful. 
This was about a goal line fumble before contact by Ekeler
This was actually my route but it’s prob about the same 
"This was also the time when the original YouTube funny videos were getting huge 
"
this was basically the reason i asked the question. i do not know nearly enough to have an informed opinion on if this is right or wrong
This was correct
This was during Marcus’ “voting is irrational, one vote doesn’t matter” rant
This was genius ahead of its time 
This was hilarious and didn’t get enough lice
This was hysterical and the haters have no taste 
This was in regards to a woman’s age. Not skiing speed
This was intended to reply to John but never sent apparently 
This was kinda funny
This was legit so funny. Marcus tees up on the far left side of the box so his feet are on the hill. I’m thinking “uh that’s weird but ok”. Becker can’t take it and says “bro what the fuck”. Marcus realizes his error and re-tees… with his back foot now on the back of the hill. Shanks it, lost ball. 
This was literally mike singletary 
This was meant to read as “oh fuck, yeah I do” re the fake rape confession, not “oh fuck yeah, I do”
This was my view on 18 for much of the day 
This was not me
This was one of my favorites 
This was posted in Air Force reddit yesterday lmao
This was spot on
This was supposed to be the moment of party unity behind trump. I ain't no English professor, but I dont think this is what unity is. 
This was surprising but I think more surprising was the half court OT buzzer beating game winner to send them to the finals. 
This was the highlight of BC football this weekend
This was the last page of the letter from the governor on why he vetoed. He makes a good point 
This was the logo of the college in San Angelo Texas where I went to intel training 
This was the original Pam snap:
This was wrong
This week in "What is a Catch?!"
This weekend works for me
This weekend would've been a good opportunity but Joe has to take the CFGAY
This whole 6 games thing does not pass the sandwich test. Yes I know rules and technicalities and stuff, but it doesn’t sit right
This whole article is about that. And there are dozens like it. 
This whole Dr thing is fucking pointless
This whole thing is gonna end up making me like brooks dammit
This world needs less sympathy for losers
This would be hilarious given the circumstances 
This would be like Steph Curry suing the Warriors because he's making less than Klay Thompson
This would be Reince Priebus (yeah that's actually his name), head of the RNC, who is pushing the strong arm. His career is over come November 
This would be robbery
This would be worth it just to piss off becker 
This would hit harder if you weren’t a Patrick Reed defender
This wouldn't even happen in 2K
This year 6 teams would’ve worked out nicely. Goodwin do the work for me and see what would’ve been the case for the past ~5 years
This year has thus far been contrary to that, evidenced by the major split in support amongst very different candidates in both parties. It could otherwise be a hint that the parties (especially the GOP) are simply weak and are failing at accomplishing this goal, despite trying. Or, in a month, Rubio and Hillary will be the clear front runners and everything will end up as the party wants when the dust settles. 
This year or last year?
This year we didn’t have a choice because we’re sunk cost with lance 
This year. He's almost surely gonna get franchised tagged
This years QB class allegedly sucks, but do they really think they can win with Wentz? Wentz has been awful for years, and contract is so bad that idk if a team should take it for nothing, let along for a 2nd, 3rd, and 2nd swap
This, except conversation topics
This, except conversation topics
This. Is. Amazing. 
THIS. LEAGUE. 
This... is the most genius idea of all time
Thomas and Freeman make sense though. Not his carry over waiver BS for half a decade
Thomas was my second guess
Thome?
Thompson’s could have good talking heads about disliking the inept “leader” of a group
Thompson's are y'all like super high level skiers?
Those $51 made the best purchase in the history of fake money
Those “we have literally everything” restaurants blow tho
Those are all just wild guesses 
Those are cool graphs though
Those are disgusting
Those are good suggestions. We will have detailed discussions on this in the offseason for sure. My thought is that people get more excited for draft day and early season, and that hype gets trodden when so many players are off the table already. Also no keepers eliminates the trading for future assets thing. 
Those are pretty negligible. I did them through IRS but I’m sure turbo tax is easier
Those are some impressive boos
Those aren't very good arguments
Those clowns can't/don't play defense for shit
Those keepers are rightfully bullshit and have hurt the league for years and will continue to do so
Those last 2 plays were just genius play design
Those last 8 minutes... all you can ask for in sports
Those mid-late 90s Braves and Yankees teams might be the 2 best starting rosters in my lifetime
Those other trades are comparable I suppose. Boogie only had one year left. PG has 2 and his haul was pretty weak. The Butler deal is just retarded lmao
Those Payton challenges hurt so bad now
Those people
Those podcasts must sound amazing with them fancy headphones
Those shaved dried fruit pastes are super common in Chinese candies and I grew up eating them. Coconut, pineapple, honey dew most common. I like them for what they are. 
those stairs were small and slippery. and right after i terminated my tumble, your roommate opened his door and looked at my splayed out body and said "wtf, uh are you alright"
Those very early two with Varelans and Tank Abbott... Jesus Christ that's brutal
Those were both high quality puns
Those were some dark ass children's books lol. There were like several cold blooded murders in each one 
Those were supposed to be solid blue. If Hilary loses any of them, it's over
Those who disliked both heavily voted trump, or voted third party. That is the main reason he won
Though amazingly, the person who posted that claim and has the hive mind agreeing, made a post just 26 days ago that long oil was the “trade of the year”
Though based on Joe’s description of the demographics, you could probably get some remodeling done on the cheap
Though both times we ended up using a broker because we had to, FWIW. So basically a bunch of searching online to end up paying some dumb bitch a fuckload of money to literally turn a key and say "do you like it?"
Though by the rules you have just agreed to, if Marcus keeps kamara for more than his projected value, you'd have to pay him for the negative savings... 
Though having to work for this asshole feels like punishment enough
Though he might not succeed to the same extent in todays NFL
Though I am surprised at your defense of civil liberties considering your other stances. Not in a bad way necessarily 
Though I don't understand why y'all would hate it
Though I guess he’s been bad on the back 9 all week
Though I will admit I'm only following on twitter
Though in hindsight I can totally understand why they did that
Though it only factors in attendance-win% correlation, not factoring in actual attendance numbers which might paint a different picture 
Though it probably does on the legislative level, just not sure if anyone actually pays attention to anything other than the letter next to the candidate's name. 
Though none were as bad as HuffPost lol
Though several of those states no longer exist...
Though weirdly I’ve lost like 5 pounds 
Thought he had it!!!!
Thought I could run a fast one by you 
Thought I read that somewhere. Either way it’s not included in the deal with new balance
Thought I was gonna get my first 2. Heartbreaking. 
Thought I was gonna get the sub 7. Still my best quordle ever
Thought I was smart getting Josh Allen MVP at like +1200 two weeks ago. Lol. 
Thought I was toast when they were 7-3. Then they lose 6 straight including to the Texans lol
Thought of Faiz when I saw this lmao
Thought of you today at work Jeff when some lady ordered gluten free beer
Thought this was interesting
Thought this was interesting
Thought those people were supposed to be good at groundskeeping 
Thought trout was gonna take one of those fastballs 480
Thought trump was effective at attacking Hillary as the definition of the establishment candidate who got us where we are. Was generally unimpressed by Hillary. Unsure if Trump comes across as a moron to the general public (or at least the folk at the margins). 
Thought you Doctors study Latin roots
Thought you were gonna pick the browns since y'all hang out so much
Thought you’d be closer to the Bernie zone
Thoughts on $15 minimum wage?
Thoughts on the garopolo rumors?
Thoughts on the NBA's age limit rule?
Thoughts? (Snake draft, so Jr is #6)
Thousands of miles? So is this some French Polynesia shit?
Threat = capability + intent. If you can’t destroy the intent, you at least destroy the capability 
Threatening to do so isn't illegal, but it's certainly a bad look because it reveals their true motivation in this case is themselves, not any meaningful story

Throwback trope
Throwing away a season would be REALLY checking that box for the Rooney rule lmao
Throwing your cochair under the bus instead of standing by the business decision. Not a great look for future C-Suite candidacy

Tidal is a joke and not a good service. Easy to pay more to the artist when you charge double what every other service does (Spotify is $10, Tidal is $20, or so I thought). And their library of music is smaller than the rest of the competition. Higher music quality? Sure that's true but I've complained about .mp3 quality exactly zero times in my life. And a higher quality file means more data required, so it kills your data plan, and songs might even buffer. Oh and they didn't prepare their tech infrastructure for the Kanye Yeezus stream so their servers got overwhelmed and people couldn't stream it
Tidal? More like TidLOL
Tied at 95, pacers ball. Lebron stuffs a driving layup, gets the board, calls TO with 3 seconds. Then off the inbound, hits a game winning buzzer beating 3

Tl;dr: due to large differences in a city/state/country's testing capabilities, a comparison of case numbers can be so far off that simple analyses can lead to drastically wrong conclusions
Tl;dr: for STEM fields, a prestigious college seems to not matter. For business and social science and other "less standard curriculum" fields, it matters significantly. Considering BC's strong suit is CSOM, BC grads on average do benefit significantly from the brand name of the school
Tl;dr: Minimum wage has risen and continues to get political pressure to rise more; wage for tipped workers is still ~$2 in most states, and that market is basically ignored by politics.  Trumps probable labor secretary is a restaurant CEO.  But in places where the tipped wage is also really high like Washington, workers aren't given enough hours and are being replaced by tablets.
Tl;dw: Pence "won". Much better calm delivery and sticking points, mostly attacking Hillary and Obama. Kaine just kinda sucked, lots of annoying interjections and defending Hillary. But Kaine always reverted to attacking Trump, which always works haha. Twitter is saying it's like Pence tried to just pretend Romney was his ticket mate.
TLaw has low key been super disappointing this season
TLaw would have made an excellent FLB
TLDR
Tldr b/c u r a lz pos: leftys throw slower and with lower spin rate than RHPs. The conventional "platoon advantage" is real, except most batters are right handed so that doesnt make any sense. The 538 theory is simply that lefties and their releases are unfamiliar, and in a sport where split-second reactions are everything, that makes all the difference
TLDR Bill James father of sabrmetrics and Red Sox analytics guru basically said that players are totally replaceable and it’s silly for teams to overspend on them for sentimental value
TLDR even the most MAGA of candidates have conceded and not called election fraud (so far). The election fraud appears to be a unique to trump move and thankfully, without him there, it’s not yet a slippery slope
Tldr it for me
Tldr many Syrian rebels consider Assad to be enemy number one. Anybody not supporting Assad is better by comparison. Hezbollah (Palestinian military/political body) supports Assad. Many Sunni militants are now not calling for the full destruction of Israel, as they have historically. 
Tldr most vials are fuller than theyre “supposed to be”. A vial is supposed to have 5 doses but it often has 6 or 7. But the FDA guideline says 5 doses per vial so the extra doses might be wasted unless the FDA changes its policies 
tldr NFL fans are saying PFF grades are trash. This PFF employee, instead of saying “no they’re actually good” basically says “they’re not meant to be a real grade, just one aspect of a larger grade which nobody publishes, but our grades aren’t meant to be taken as grades even though we publish them on every NFL broadcast”
Tldr the Tldr: Greedy asshole doctors are ruining everything 
Tldr:
TLDR: a 20 year old kid named Jacob Wohl is a trump supporting white nationalist. He’s tied to an accusation of sexual assault by an unknown woman against mueller, but the woman probably doesn’t exist. Instead, it’s been revealed that his company “surefire intelligence” offered $30K to women to accuse mueller of assault, he denied all ties to this company. But he Company is registered under his email, the phone number goes to his MOMs house, and all the “employees” linked in pages are stock photos or celebrities. 
Tldr: all the money currently not going to the players is used to subsidize the other sports. If half that money now goes to players, those other sports lose a ton of their income and are much more likely to be cut
Tldr: An actor from that show empire said he was targeted and beaten by 2 white men wearing MAGA hats. Chicago police have done an extremely extensive investigation, and there were suspicions about his story. There are now reports that he staged the attack on himself, possibly because he was afraid he was being written out of the show. 
Tldr: Bernie voters make no sense. E.g. 26% of Bernie supporters would rather vote for Trump over Elizabeth Warren. Only 79% of Bernie’s supporters said they would vote for Buttigieg over Trump. And only 51% of current Bernie supporters actually voted in the 2016 Election for Hillary Clinton
Tldr: Biden is significantly underperforming hillary in Miami Dade county, which is the whole impetus for Florida looking very grim for Biden 
Tldr: Buy life insurance, because the State Farm crew will kill you
Tldr: Coinbase said no more politics at work, it’s getting to the point where it’s a major distraction from the company mission. If you don’t like it, we’ll give you a fat severance package on your way out. 
TLDR: Cowboys, Giants, Packers, Steelers, and Pats are shoved in everyone's faces (in that order). Nobody cares about the Bills, Browns, Jags, and Bucs.
Tldr: cuts costs by eliminating nonpayers and administrative work
Tldr: don’t buy Ross
Tldr: Elon’s proposal would be everything Putin wants with zero thought to the Ukrainian perspective as the invaded (and winning?) people. And it demonstrates zero understanding of the situation from the get go. 
Tldr: give block grants to the states, let them decide what to do with the money. Also cut Medicaid funding.
Tldr: Good accuracy within 20, poor accuracy on deep balls.  Terrible pocket presence.  Great presnap read ability.
TLDR: having a shitty fan base hurts MLB teams a LOT more than NBA or NFL, and having ownership who alienates the fans is even worse
Tldr: if you unwittingly have it and you go out, you just probably infected dozens of people, who will continue to spread it, and an otherwise 99% successful containment effort fails because of you
Tldr: it's debatable. I'll wait for a 538 article on it.
Tldr: Jones entire defense is that he took turinabol accidentally. A doctor defending him said the minuscule amount tested positive for is proof. When cross examined, he admitted this is based on him reading online that bodybuilders take more than that and doesn’t actually know shut about how turinabol works
Tldr: LOL AFC East
Tldr: major shitshow, not ending any time soon
Tldr: nobody does shit 
Tldr: nobody’s mind was changed, nobody is now more or less likely to vote, the plurality people are 100% certain X candidate is going to win
Tldr: Plan so that you don't let a black swan fuck the whole system?
Tldr: please come back to the league, we are willing to make changes
Tldr: probably not
Tldr: Pusha made fun of drake for using ghostwriters on Daytona. Then Drake released a corny ass response saying “yeah but my ghostwriter was working double shifts at Publix and I brought him up out of that, and also you rap about drug dealing but you’re not that hard”. Now Pusha T just released a clapback song like “yeah well fuck you, you abandoned your mom and your son hates you”
Tldr: QB Pressures are overrated (but still valuable) while sacks are drive-breaking
Tldr: Separate the markets between payers (middle and upper class) and non-payers (the poor). Payers keep the classic healthcare insurance system. Nonpayers can't afford the classic system, so the US creates a new healthcare industry: doctors who are much cheaper and also less extensively trained.
Tldr: Specialists treat patients like money making opportunities, give unnecessary procedures, charge too much, and often aren't doing anything a primary care doctor could do. But they have convinced the public that they do, and also form societies that are powerful lobbyists
Tldr: Stoppage time is usually half of what it’s supposed to be for most games
Tldr: students know nothing about their own loans. 8% know what their interest rate is. 6% know how long they're paying their loans off for. 37% say they "disagree / strongly disagree" that they'll be able to pay off their debt
Tldr: teams would pay their players 47% of salary and break even. The MLB owners proposal was for 24%, which would net them a $1.1 billion profit, which is almost identical to the profit from a full season. 
Tldr: the AG Barr summary report of the mueller report last month essentially said there was no collusion and no obstruction. The actual full mueller report dropped this morning, and basically Barr’s summary was bullshit. The report says that the Trump campaign was flirty with the Russians in the collusion world. And culpable in the obstruction world, but that a sitting president cannot be indicted, so he’s passing the judgement to Congress
Tldr: the biggest reason healthcare costs so much is actually providers, even though insurance companies are the ones who get scapegoated. And the biggest barrier to lowering costs is providers not wanting to get pay cuts.
Tldr: The Bottom right corner is “like neither”. In 2016, the people in this category voted Trump 47-30. In 2020 thus far, they prefer Biden 55-22.
Tldr: the Cowboys are the most hated team in the league, but that's due to the visceral hatred from the rest of the NFC east. The Pats the second most hated team, and are the most evenly hated across all NFL fans
Tldr: the London games feature shitty teams but they've usually been pretty competitive games, these 2 last ones notwithstanding 
Tldr: the original grassroots organizers were hostilely taken over by a group called Gathering for Justice. They realized the power of the Women's March brand, came in under the guise of helping, and stole all the donations money for their own purposes.  They are also vocally anti-semitic.
Tldr: the problem is people who can't pay their bill. It fucks the patient, and the hospital. So take those people and provide them a different type of healthcare that costs less and also isn't as good, that they can afford. 
TLDR: the tankie IG channel that faiz repeatedly posts is almost certainly a Russia funded company with a history of social media propaganda 
"Tldr: there are about 475k blue users, <0.2% of 254MM daily active users. Half of those have <1k followers.

There are 420k legacy verified users. Only 6500 (1.5%) have bought blue. "
Tldr: they keep malfunctioning during games, and they're unreliable. And he can't practice with them during the week so he's saying fuck it I'm gonna use pen and paper 
Tldr: they store, manage, and secure billions of terabytes of data for other companies, like banks
Tldr: they're a cookie cutter Giant consulting firm, exactly the same as Deloitte, IBM, EY, PWC, etc. 
Tldr: what’s happening in Wisconsin now has happened all the time in modern American history, by both parties. It’s unbecoming, but certainly not unprecedented. In fact it’s super precedented, and the context in recent American history makes it a lot less outragey 
Tldr: yes america basically won the war for the allies, but if the bloodiest war in history at that point dragged on for another 4 years then WW2 wouldn’t have happened maybe idk who needs evidence it’s the New York Times. And then Wilson was mean to the people who didn’t join the war effort. And now Veterans Day doesn’t explicitly call out WWI’s end as the reason for its date, which is proof everyone forgot about it. 
"Tldr:
1) Biden
2) Kamala Harris
3) Lizzie W
4) Kristen Gillibrand
5) The Bern
6) Eric Holder
7) Steve Bullock, Gov of Montana
8) Cory Booker"
Tldr; American people are a bunch of hypocrites and flip floppers about the security vs privacy debate
Tldr; it's possible to interpret the constitution to bar him, but it probably won't happen enough for him to be DQed
Tldr?
TLDR?

To answer your question Becker, the goal of the state is to sustain itself
To be clear I am against using gay as a catch all insult. I am for using it pejoratively when someone says or does something gay (like suggest 12 bad boys rent a romantic getaway villa in Tuscany)

Unfortunately Goody is the only one who said he’d come back. Chan, jeff, and John all said no."
To show her you’d face your biggest fears for her
To the commons!!!!
To the first point, a UN (LOL) administered vote in an war zone, where you either vote Russian or die, to a population that just got invaded, is absurd. Let alone the assumption that Russia will just accept the results if they lose, after literally invading Ukraine 6 months ago, is even more absurd. Russia already agreed to the Ukrainian borders and sovereignty (including crimea) in 1994, obviously that means nothing. Then “Ukraine remains neutral” wtf does that even mean? They’re not a part of NATO or the EU? They were “neutral” when they got invaded? It just doesn’t have any bearing in reality
To the rest of you: I hope you recognize that 24B has established itself as a serious contender. Dont sleep on the gentlemen from across the grass...

"Trolley problem for the uninitiated:

There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:
1. Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.
2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

True but at least you never blew up at me for saying you were “chirping”
True but at the end of the day it was my fault and nobody else’s.
True but cooking is negative 1000 FPMs so eating out is worth it
True but I can also get that on pornhub...
true but i had to leave you off the list, as is tradition
True but I’m ok betting against flukes and if they happen then that’s football
True but I'm surprised he's signed by anybody 
True but it's not as accurate
True but not “offensive”
True but that’s on top of all the shaft
True but that's also majorly because of Lebron (I think Kyrie and Love are both hugely overrated tbh). Put him on any team with 2/3 defensive big men and where the rest of the team can shoot 3s, and you got a championship contender right there
True but why run RPOs when Zappe deep ball is the most unstoppable play in the NFL

True story: I had no idea who Devin was until this past weekend when Joe and Goody explained it to me
True story: Mark melancon does yoga, hunter pence did it with him once and said it was the hardest workout of his life
True technically not single player. Never played either lol. Isn't it a subscription based model?
True the distance is something I’d never have seen before... Overlooked that
True true. If he can come up with a good way to stop tanking then he deserves a nobel prize
True, 2 each. I guess I should've paid more attention to those teams during the reg season
True, but even then you use the grip on their pants to control their legs, and the lapels to control their torso
True, but it was by far the most pronounced there
True, but it's probably meaningless because nobody scores. I'd rather have more goals (like at least ONE per team per game) so the scores are 3-2 instead of 1-0
True, but like if Carmelo or Lebron said this, I would put it in my "why I dislike him" repertoire 
True, just that blind uphill second which can be awkward on the downslope
True, so sub the entire population of the Philippines for the entire population of Ireland
True, they all involve anesto

True. Brady is such a leader that he motivated the defense to have an all time great season

Trump also has a history of being quite fond of Putin. There are lots of tweets and quotes. Also, it is very possible Trump has significant financial contribution from Russian bodies. We'll have to wait for the tax return to prove it though 
Trump also just said one of the allegations is false because the woman is too ugly for him to want to assault. "Look at her, I don't think so"
Trump also risked his life in Vietnam 
Trump also tweeted “poles” first then deleted and corrected

Trump has zero proper nouns other than Atlantic City. Shows how specific he is when talking about issues.

Trump is already calling the election illegitimate and calling for the end of American democracy if he loses. Idk how any policy disagreement could top that in importance.

Trump is such a sack of shit 
Trump NFTs is not something I had on my bingo card
Trump paid 24% in 2005. That's literally it. 
Trump paid no taxes for a decade. He paid $750 in 2014 and 2015. He loses tens of millions every year. There is likely major accounting fraud. And he has giant pieces of debt coming due with no way to pay them
Trump says you don’t actually need them
Trump should nominate Merrick garland and it would tear a hole in the space time continuum
Trump speaks line from his own speech, then immediately "Wow I didn't know that"
Trump talks about sports like LeBron talks about books
Trump voters would not go to Hillary though
Trump was the one will small hands get yo insults right!
Trump will win NY, but if he doesn't sweep delegates, it will be very difficult for him to ever get majority. The article is old but it's still up to date since that fact hasn't changed. So while the news story will say Trump Wins, the real story will be exactly how well he performed in each district. All we can do is wait and see

Turns out Marcus was right all along, it could’ve been any of these practices, not just the one on 30 sept

Two of my teammates are big Georgia fans and every Monday morning they jerk each other off about how Georgia should’ve dominated by more and is getting no respect from the media despite being back to back champs and still ranked #1. Reminiscent of Pats fans tbh.

UFC 37.5 was a last minute event (38 had already been announced) and it doesn't look like it was broadcast live. It was meant to promote the UFC on Best Damn Sports Show Period, which would air the best fight of the night. It was also broadcast in entirety on PPV at some later date

Update 
Update on $SNAP
Update on the failed drug test.  So turns out they never should've issued by badge; they did so preemptively.  AmEx does care about the positive test apparently.  So I can either dispute the test, which I might retest the same sample or retest with new sample (not sure which).  Or I can admit it and ask for it to be waived.  Sorta shitting bricks right now.
"Update on the war for those interested:
Russia has been defeated and withdrawn from their main offensive front (toward Kiev from the north, also toward Sumy and Chernihiv from the north and north east). It is this withdrawal that led to the Ukrainian army recapturing these towns on the path and seeing these war crime scenes. 
It looks most likely that Russia will reposition to reinforce the offensives in the east and northeast around the donbass, possibly near Kharkiv in the north. Possible goal is to pincer and cut off Ukrainian forces in the area and negotiate a surrender. But given what we’ve seen so far I’d say this is unlikely to be accomplished. 
I think we’re just waiting to see what Russian maneuver will look like at this point. "

Very difficult to pin the cause of inflation but the ban on Russian energy and the supply chain issues in China are doubtless causes of price hikes. And Econ 101 tells you that cost increases (from supply shocks and/or inflation) are shared by both the companies and the consumers. 
Very disappointed by lack of enthusiasm
Very Donald Trump-esque thing to say Joe. Not surprised you and Brady both support him
Very easy tbh, a little dry but greens are good. I shot par through 5 today, 6 was a driveable par 4 and I hit it close and duffed the chip for a bogey. Parred 7 and 8, then narrowly hit OB on 9 with a drive because of the wind, so took a double. 
Very entertaining. Good note becks
Very fair points, so let's extrapolate. Only 1% of patients comprise 21.8% of the total healthcare spending. Do we apply the same logic, that they're entitled to subsidies from the other 99% because of xyz reasons?

Very insightful. Is there any vague idea of a solution for this whole insurer-practicer price setting problem? And is it intertwined with the coverage problem?
Very interesting thread here. Worth the 45 second read 
Very interesting. Not great for the KP
Very interesting. So in the 95% vs 5% in healthcare, you take from the 95% to give to the 5%.  But in the Trolley Problem, you act to save the 5 people and sacrifice the 1.

Very thorough (and long), data science-based article on the difficulties in interpreting and comparing Covid case numbers
Very true goody. Literally 4 days ago he says "i know things about the DNC hacks that nobody else does. I'll announce tomorrow". No announcement, nobody cares. 
Very true Joe. And goody as well. His coolness is a lot of his appeal
Very true. But I think you can sub Latino with Mexican here.
Very true. Starcraft is the same way with the learning curve, but it's 1v1 so no community shenanigans really. And also there is a campaign mode. Hearthstone on the other hand is real easy to pick up, and the campaign mode is made for beginners
Very. They charge out the wazzoo if you don’t comply with their stated rules.

Run 5 miles
Jerk off
Eat 4 donuts and drink 4 beers
Run 5 miles
Jerk off
Eat 4 donuts and drink 4 beers

"Wake up. Jerk off 3 times, also having 2 doughnuts and 2 beers during that time. Then start with a nice easy 3 mile jog to wake up. Cool down with a mile walk and another 2 doughnuts, and jerk off again. Drink 3 more beers. Power nap and wake up with another JO. 3 mile jog, 1 mile walk, 2 doughnuts, JO, beer.

You're now at 6 JOs, 6 doughnuts, 8 miles, 6 beers. You have the rest of the day to drink 4 beers / eat 18 doughnuts, and travel 4 miles. Totally doable. "

Wanna feel old? Reminder that Allen is 23 and Watson is 24
Wanna give me a tl;dw of the game?
Wanna go on record and say the current system is pretty damn good and I prefer it to almost everything else
Wanna hear a flaming hot political take? Men should not have to pay child support if they have no say on abortion
Wanna hear yalls opinions: Top 5 and Bottom 5 teams in the NFL

Want to readdress something brought up earlier:
Wanted Mason to go down but we’ll take it!
Wanted to go uninsured until I got another job but couldn’t do that. So I’m paying $240 a month
Wanted to make sure I wasn’t overthinking anything 
WaPo even said they're not gonna publish all the details of what was leaked because they don't wanna risk anyone dying
"War EagLOL
North CarLOLina"
War is especially wonky with pitchers, since BBRef uses ERA and FanGraphs uses FIP (or vice versa)
War was in 1896 and lasted 38 minutes
Warner sniffs out the screen on 3rd and long, fights through the RG and gets the stop. Then Deebo with the incredible dodge in open field for the 75 yard TD
Warren Sharp is a hack tho
Warrens been really impressive not gonna lie
Warrens candidacy does nothing but hurt the party IMO
Warriors 1975. Only one before 2015
Warriors are going to SF
Warriors are playing so soft. Not boxing out and getting bodied on rebounds, losing every lose ball. And their offense is just stagnant again, sitting in half court and playing ISO ball and forcing passes
Warriors big trade with the wolves
Warriors don't draw up plays barely at all though lol. They play in the transition on all but inbound plays
Warriors in 7
Warriors jersey with Lyft sponsor patch
Warriors look better on both offense and defense I'd say, but a few bad misses both inside and outside. Cavs have nailed their 3s but have otherwise been defended well
Warriors need to get their shit together
Warriors starters matched Klay on Kyrie, Steph on JR, Dray/KD on Love/Lebron, and Zaza on Thompson
"Warriors to SF in 2019
Ders to LV in 2020
As to LV in 202X"
Warriors won't sign KD unless it makes them more likely to win a championship. If Barnes Livingston and Iggy go, that'd be acceptable. Bogut would need to use the stretch provision. And they'd need to have some very good players to replace the bench
Was 18, now it’s 13
Was also considering Cooks or even Tavon for the fastest guy on the field 
Was anybody invited to Vinny’s wedding?
WAS Brissett $10/1 > TB Baker $8.5/1
Was browsing r/thesilphroad last night and the expected future functionality for this game is insane!!
Was chatting with @#JustFacts✅ and discussed holding our Fantasy Draft in NOLA. Obviously @Confused has the final word, but I think it could be a really fun event and we’ll all be there already. What do you guys think?
Was Emyr the one of your friends getting high on the night when you first met?
Was he always like this?
Was hoping for <1% with those 2 giants players but I still like them
Was it “this will be symbolic of how serious I am”?
Was it always 10 blocks?
Was it avocado cake?
Was it EMC or VMWare?
Was it in person or in here?
Was it more?
Was it Tom Brady who complained about it?
Was it Zach Wilson’s mom who went psycho on social media?
Was Jon Jones in there?
Was Papa Tigre really like that? I know he pushed Tiger to practice an insane amount but I don't remember anything about him pulling Lavar Ball stunts
Was really hoping he’d say “that’s probably taken out of context” “well there you go. That’s context”
Was really hoping the Cowboys would grab one of those guys but nope it’s just fat fucking Zeke
Was scheduled to start and the white sox were wearing these wonky old school jerseys that didn't tuck in and Sale hated them. So he took a pair of scissors and cut up all the jerseys so he didn't have to wear them. He was scratched from the start...
Was senior year really thrift shop or dark horse or wrecking ball? 
Was supposed to be 8:1 but marcus gave me 9:1 because he can’t math
Was supposed to start Monday. Hoping for later in the week now, if not then week after
Was Tara Reade one of the accusers?
Was that a catch??
Was that footage taken while the Celtics game was on 🤔 
Was that the 9=8 year?
Was that the other Lockett moment?
Was the beating worthy?
Was the PK challenge the apex of this GroupMe?
Was there a bet on vaccines between the stethoscope boiz?
Was there no more fallout from the #ASMB post?
Was thinking him but too short of a career... Same with McGwire
Was thinking the same. But I guess it's quite bad in dollars per hour
Was this the rest stop before the troops got us out of a speeding ticket?
Was too young to remember well but weren't beanie babies a big thing for several years?
Was wondering if they were gonna publish this too but they did. Rolled up on his wife at the same time
Washington could never capitalize 
Washington Redtails has my vote
Wasn’t Bauer’s first year also team-induced?
Wasn’t it bogdanovic himself?
Wasn’t OBJ a legit soccer star?
Wasn’t Rodgers Hail Mary against them too?
Wasn’t that from like 2 weeks ago and predictably preempted a big layoff last week?
Wasn’t that the same year the broncos were 28 point favorites over the Jags
Wasn't a huge fan either tbh. DNA was kinda catchy but no hits other than that
Wasn't a huge fan of Madrid. Enjoyed it, but one of my least favorite of the European cities I went to  
Wasn't deandre Jordan 1st team last year?
Wasn't he an Econ major?
Wasn't it you who said he's already in that class?
Wasn't PayPal 
Wasserman said “I’ve seen enough” for Warnock/Loeffler and the man is never wrong
WAT THE FACK
Watch Andy Dalton be the next Tony Romo in 2 years
Watch it
Watch Jamie randomly know all of them lol
Watch my snapchat homie 
Watch Obama try appoint himself, fucking egomaniac
Watch out QB Guru
Watch that video Becker. It’s like 10 minutes 
Watch the Ners go out and make Drew Stanton look like an MVP
Watched Full Swing E1. 5/10, nothing special. Just a recap of the first two majors with the backdrop of LIV (pre merger announcement)
Watched like 3 episodes of HotD. Wasn’t interested
Watched one season. It was ok
Watched the presser again. I less think trump is trying to appease his base and more think this is actually what he believes
Watching
Watching boyfriend girlfriend fights is way funnier when they're both wearing Santa suits
Watching Darrow off the tee is electric. Idk how he generates that much speed while being a statue from the waist down 
Watching games and reading articles and breakdowns apparently is totally different when you’re out of country
Watching goody/becker kick out the midge
Watching pros practice is more fun than watching a game.  The stuff they can do with the ball is ridiculous, but they'd never do it in a game...
Watching that fourth quarter facing Joe’s Pats D in fantasy was excruciating 
watching the bachelor is not a zero sum game. because watchers lose and nobody gains.
Watching the slow motion dismantling of the team that had 3 consecutive NFC CG appearances, played out through Yorks public mean girls style fighting with Harbaugh was unbelievably painful. 
Water is patients. Buckets are doctors
Watershed day for coronavirus: travel ban, NBA season suspended, Tom Hanks tested positive (seems lol but actually tho), schools everywhere cancel
Watkins is a bun
Watkins 😳
Watson
Watson 11 games $5 million 
Watson just takes so many sacks
WATSON SKRONG
Watson to the Panthers makes the most sense to me, but I’ve read rumors Seahawks are the favorite
Watts are prob better at their positions. But the QB weight is too much 
Way fewer ethnic slurs 
Way to confuse everyone again not even funny
Way to early 2020 top 5: CMC, Dalvin Cook, Zeke, Henry, Mike Thomas
Way to leverage the 2024 DEI established groupings
Way to ruin our fun. Good job government.
Way too difficult to just see a doctor. Yet another reason America needs the Kelleher Plan
Wayfairs website had listed some furniture items at absurdly high prices (like $30k) and the names of the items were often people’s (missing childrens?!) names

WCW is Woman Crush Wednesday. He has a habit of posting a picture of a (usually BC) girl and writing a love letter in hashtags to her. 
We ain’t getting younger smh
We all agree gushers are the gold standard of non-chocolate candy right?
We all had opportunities all summer, you couldn't do it. We've been waiting for you for months. I suggest Labor Day, you agree and say one of the two days you're going to the tournament, we Plan around you again, then you back out. It is your fault. 
We all have similar BMIs
We all know BCEagle222 has always been a die hard Dartmouth fan
We all saw how touchdown Tom did with those guys last year
We all wanna say we wouldn’t cave but mannnn I just don’t know
We all went to a 4 year private university and half of us went to grad school. We are all coastal elites whether we like it or not
We already knew your answer becker 
We also added 1 more flex. I recommend we add another WR spot (assuming we stay at 8) but that has not been discussed. Neither has PPR or any other keeper modifications yet. 
We also completely built a new stadium and relocated the team in order to stimulate the struggling Silicon Valley economy. Our team cares foremost about fostering the community. 
We also gave up a walkoff HR 2 games before that
We also have 8 sit / leans, 2 squats, 1 stand, 1 both, and 1 Trevor 
We also have a disproportionate amount of white 🐐s, especially on the left side
We also have an open bet on if Lebron wins another ship in his career
We also need a price range 
We also need to discuss league dues.  I believe $50 was last year's fee
We also never looked at TLaw takes
We also usually do 10 man leagues. But I’m fine with either 
We are actually a joke
We are all pro-vax in here and (probably) all think anti-vaxxers are stupid. But if saving the most lives possible is the only goal, then we should regulate other unhealthy choices too, which is inherently illiberal.
WE ARE SO BACK
We are such terrible friends 
We are the 47%!
We are the worst
We both got in trouble, might’ve been the level 3 probation I don’t really remember 
We call it the “Phil Jurkovec (but good this time)”
We call it the multipurpose room
We can add her to the quarantine list 
We can add it to the FH combine 
We can add pitch speed to the fuckhole combine
We can barely track our money on a single base, let alone all the bases, research orgs, contracts, etc
We can change you to Bomber WSO
We can do it after the next Fuckhole Open when you plan it
We can go to McSorleys 
We can play some sort of 2v2 game
We can prob just use some field near Marcus’ house
We can talk about the G20 protests in Hamburg and how protestors in all first word countries seem to be little more than violent anarchists who are counterproductive to making others sympathize with their cause
We can’t even get 8 dudes to schedule a fantasy draft and Frankie out here trying to get 13 dudes to run a mile
We can't win that fight, goodwin has dragons. Do you guys learn nothing from wieners?
We could add KyBock? I know connor would play. 
We could call our company the Meat Jerking Beef Boys
We could call the secondary league "the confederacy" or something
We could do a FH Movie Club. Like the minor leagues of the Book Club
We could do the game, draft Saturday afternoon, golf Sunday
We could give him a baton to run with like in a relay. Maybe call it the “Baton Death Run” or something 
We defeated mock ISIS 
We definitely need to have a Fuckholes football match
We did it boys. Successfully didn’t lose to Kansas and the Gers back to back
We did it guys!!!!!
We didn’t know at the time but we lived through the golden age of comedy at the perfect time 
We didn’t spend enough time clowning the 12-4 Seahawks for losing to a team who started Jon “LinkedIn” Wolford at QB
We didn’t win the championship. Lost in the semis. I finished with 3 dingers, and a lot of warning track power humble pie. Yet another stumble in my quest to be a slow pitch softball legend.
We didn't bang afterwards :(
We didn't, played Newton Comm on Saturday. I shot an 82 with zero birds, one of my better rounds there ever actually 
We discussed this and we don’t want to let them win, but it’s really the only option. So yeah we’ll see how that goes 
We do
We do have Kyle Shanahan as our coach 🤔 
We don’t have a chipotle
We don’t have GCSs in Omaha
We don't *spend* enough money
We don't have your depth of sports knowledge, keen logic, or massive dick
We either have to work around Jameson’s birthday or the following weekend, when Jamie is semi-available and becker also has to request off. Or we can do a weekday late 
we gave up so much
We get rui hachimura
We getting too spoilery
We give up if that’s the “fairly obvious” one
We go High - Chance the Rapper ft. Navi
We going to patrons
We got 2 big privileges today: 1) phones on all weekends, 2) we can talk during meals
We got a good prospect for Pomeranz
We got a new class in and the MTIs are busy yelling at them 
We got one more week
We got some marital problems live from the Gulag Twitter
We gotta plan a weekend for this
We had 2 lol
We had a ranked win in 2018 when we hosted game day
We had a real interesting convo in my class today about ethno-nationalism and racism. Started with a discussion on how Russians think inherently differently than Americans do, and how their military decision making reflects that. Did the same about china, and the topic morphed into how generalizing a whole ethno-nationality would be widely considered racist in 2019 America. Lot of back and forth, but the conclusion was basically that every culture does have a truly different mindset, and understanding that mindset is key to the Intel mission. So the idea of treating all cultures the same is actually detrimental to the field, even though it’s “racist” per se.
We had MREs for 3 days straight last week
We had no keepers. It’s the same thing. 
We had one in feb, and results were that our directorate was above average (in a good way) in stress level. And some civilian woman stood up during the all call and said “actually I think we’re under reporting our stress levels because we’re taught to internalize it”. The collective eye roll from all the military folks was palpable
We had to give a short briefing on a country. I got Ukraine, and after my briefing, I mentioned Chernobyl and made this reference. About 1/4 of the class got it
we had zero animosity within like 48 hours of the kerfuffle.  probably a good sign that we could be friends
We have 11 days including arrival/departure. Doing Dublin, then Galway, then Ennis, then Cork, then back to Dublin to fly out
We have a combatives tournament on Thursday and that’s the only thing I’m looking forward to. Otherwise they give us like 4 hours to do assignments that take 30 minutes 
We have a lot of Fuckholes events that commissioner darrow needs to plan
We have a new pilot in our unit. Capt Ferguson, callsign “Riot”
We have another release today so i have lots of "bandwidth". Lets keep busy in here!
We have Armed Forces Network in the chow hall and other places around base but I’m streaming in my room now
We have good discussions in here :)
We have received your application to the cabal and will respond in due time
We have similar approaches 
We have this bullshit quarterly Accenture @ Golddicks global call. And they have this "consultant spotlight" slide where one person from each geography writes a little blurb about themselves. I had to be that guy this time. People's blurbs are boring as fuck, like "fun fact: I enjoy studying big data analytics". So I decide to but a bit of humor in and I write "Fun Fact: Was occasionally picked in the top 20 in dodgeball in 3rd grade PE". On the call the moderator gets to my blurb and reads it in the classic deadpan work voice.... and literally nobody laughs.
We have to be in the top .001% of GroupMe groups by message count
We have to do it or we have small dicks
We have to plan a different weekend than 7/9 because Joe can't make it
We have too many states. 50 is way too many. Why not just have just 1 or 2. Simplify the system 
We haven’t booked anything but tell us if you’re in
We just gonna ignore becker putting a fucking crustacean in his meat power rankings?
We just gonna ignore John Thompson, very serious stock trader, getting his daily fix of Jim Cramer?
We just gonna ignore that the Kaisers predated the Nazis?
We just gonna ignore whatever the hell WAR CLOUDS are?
We leave for our mock deployment today so that should be fun at least
We literally discussed this on Saturday and I told you why, but I'll say it again. Chan volunteered to host, Chan seemed excited about it, Chan likes hosting events and has a history of hosting cool events. All you said was its more inconvenient for you and you live 20 minutes away.
We literally just talked about how the point of a punishment is to prevent tanking, and the punishment is the punishment so now arbitrary interpretations of competitive balance and tanking don't have to exist
We made a mistake not giving UCF more shit
We make our predictions. Most correct states wins. 
We may, and I cannot believe I’m saying this, legitimately look back and see the Addazio years as the last set of decent seasons
We mix in a few jokes and call it “Bortles Chortles”
We need a BC crazy power rankings
We need a Brady Washed meter like the Flacco Elite meter
We need a redraft 
We need a Trump - Drake vs Biden - Pusha tag team WWE match
We need a week 0 power rankings
We need a worst fan bases power rankings!
We need fantasy wordle yesterday 
We need future BC AD @First to Worst to enlighten us 
We need raptor logo inception
We need the Democrats to get their shit together and not blow this golden opportunity by infighting
We need to invade Venus ASAP
We need to show Frankie the quarantine houses list
We need to standardize if we’re doing hard mode or not
We never selected an NFL team
We now await goodwins power rankings of the playlists
We now have 4 publicly shared salaries
We only had like 4 of the 35 or so girls in my middle school do the whale tailing, but yeah I didn't hate it. All of them were pretty hot
We ordered Kelly’s last night and I wanted horseradish cream on my roast beef, and they didn’t have it, and he looked at me like I was an idiot
We out of here baby
We prefer to trade them for more valuable draft picks for guys who won’t see the field
We preserve the integrity of the game. It's why we cut Aldon Smith despite his talent. We don't tolerate that kind of  behavior
We revisited it
We sat right next to the dealer and Becker was giving me the basics like “most people play far too many hands” and “people don’t take their position into account” and the dealer lady kept saying “mmmmhmmmm” 
We see it with so many washed athletes in all sports. MMA is probably the clearest example
We should all be ashamed for ever even considering buying the Browns hype. How quickly we forgot that they are the Browns.
We should ask Jeremy how he could be a gym leader but only a LT
We should base points off Win Probability Added per play since it's the best measure of value
We should be bigger Xander fans
We should be careful not to undermine what's gotten us here
We should call this rule book little florin
We should capitulate and let Marcus back in
We should copy whatever northwestern does because they are very comparable but our superior in both sports and athletics
We should develop wordLOL
We should have 3 picks and a TD
We should have a fuckholes cook off
We should have a groupme for fantasy football
We should have a subreddit for medical questions
We should have an award for The Cosby, awarded to the loser by the winner of the matchup with the biggest margin of defeat in a season
We should hold an annual Fuckholes 10K to shame becker every year 
We should just eliminate keepers
We should next year
We should split the country into a smoking section and nonsmoking section
We should start a chipotle-style restaurant but instead of Mexican meats we do different kinds of kebab meat and sauces 
We should start a list
We should switch to a 3QB league
We should use golf boards
We should wait for the #QBW to speak
we shouldve been farmers with all the strawmen we set up
We should've redrafted before this season, the only one with a huge gripe wouldve be been goody, and he quit
We singles live empty lives of quiet desperation and will die alone
We slept in the same bed, then got to know each other after
We spend all our time with the same group of 18 so it’s not like you can branch out and make friends. I certainly get along with some more than others tho
We talked about classical music :)
We thought the real world would take the whiny bullshit out of the new workforce when they left college. Turns out they took kept their whiny bullshit and took over the working world.
We truly are dead to him. RIP FH
We truly didn’t know what we had until it was gone 
We unfortunately had two kids get caught gay sex in the bathroom. They were sophomores when I was a senior. Way to break the all boys HS stereotype, thanks guys. 
We used to get fins delivered to the golf course. I think around the 6/7 hole where the clubhouse is
We want Bama
We went over this a while ago. Jeff insisted he is out
We went to the Super Bowl with Jimmy G!! Who is literally worse than Aidan “Who Bitch This Is?” O’Connell
We were 24B joe
We were definitely not moving in the right direction 
We were discussing that today. Can’t tell if it’s pilot error on the throttle or a mechanical issue with the engine
We were ranked last year and we lost to Kansas this year. That’s enough said for me
We were talking about our first days at BC and Steven Wu was one of the first kids I met in Hardey
We were wrong. Joe didn’t vote for Trump, he voted for a different party
We will miss you 😢 
We will miss you, hero
We will put mark wahlberg on the other pylon. Believe he said “if I was on that aircraft, it wouldn’t have gone down that way” 
We will wait for joe 
We won't know anything legit until the actual vote counts begin, which is around 8 I think
We would be like Howard Stern on steroids for them
We would know this isn’t true because we haven’t heard about it incessantly 
We wouldn’t be allowed. We’re military aged men.

We’re all jaggin off tonight
We’re barely over 5 months away from kickoff
We’re becker at the beach and Anesto is racist Florida man. We can appreciate the absurdity but it’s sure as hell our business to change it
We’re facing each other in baseball rn
We’re gonna need to build a super gulag inside the gulag
We’re gonna try the long distance thing
We’re literally playing golf next Thursday AND Friday morning
We’re not eating until 9, and may go to the landsdowne afterward
We’re on to Chicago
We’re probably not hanging out this weekend then lol
We’re probably the only league in the world where our dues are lower than our median age
We’re still in the denial phase. “He’s barely played, he’s gonna be a stud once he develops”
We’re talking about the Texans win streak
We’re the 90s Yankees like this? Where it was like “why even watch or care, what’s the point”
We’re there other accusers or was it this only the one girl accusing all of them?
We’re up to around 4 million a week total, so prob around 1-1.5 mil assuming it’s roughly even between the 3
We’re y’all like 10% less distance?
We’ve been over this. You can’t pick a team with O/U of 9+ to be the TotF

Welfare state meaning general benefits to the public, like free education. You can't have both unregulated influxes of immigrants and a system that gives free shit to everybody inside the borders. That's obviously unsustainable. 
Well #1 is Sandy Koufax
Well 1) He went ham on Drew Brees for his comments on kneeling, then turns around 2 weeks later and says “Jewish people aren’t our problem”. And 2) he’s pretty much saying the BLM issue is all that matters, and confronting other forms of racism is really not that important. 
Well 4/5 because I had neither Ole Miss or MSU
Well actually there’s Elon, but one who’s less high profile
Well after today I’m more worried BC is gonna become another UMass
Well Al Frankens presidential chances sure hit the tubes right about now 
Well anyway I was thinking that would be a great weekend to hold the Throwdown in Beantown (and also for me to take the SAT)
Well anyway the primary reason for the Trump upset was that blacks voted about 90% of their expected turnout rate in the key swing states, which evidences that Obama was an unprecedentedly good campaigner and Hillary was closer to the true normal. Most of the leftward swing occurred in deep red states like Utah and Texas which didn't matter electorally.
Well anyway, Pence actually seems decently impressive, except when he defends trump. Kaine is playing attack dog and doing poorly at it
Well as someone with the worst QBs in the league, I would've been interested in bortles if I knew you were giving him away for free
Well as tempted as I am to pull some shenanigans, our bet was “finishes his term”, so as a principal of man, I will accept my loss
Well at least I win $35 #TeamMoney
Well Bernie's continued denial of the rules of nomination is getting tedious and cringeworthy. But as he was getting closer and closer to elimination, his supporters stepped on the gas in terms of violence and harassment 
Well besides the obvious, because there are tens of thousands of people who are actively attempting to do so, and there are worldwide networks with the sole purpose of achieving that goal
Well boys I gave it a shot 
Well by "candidates positions", do you mean highly publicized quotes or actual views on policy? 
Well clearly in this mask situation, you have the fucking president spreading this garbage which is causing a pandemic to be worse. So I’m ok with it here. Normally I agree with you Marcus but this is something else
Well considering my first memory of you was you blacking out on your 21st birthday and thinking the hallway was the bathroom, I can only dream of what a pre-21 goody could have been
Well considering there's no precedent for any of this, my suggestion was an attempt at fairness to the both of us. The alternative is what you described: keep the integrity of both teams, coin flip on who gets which team. Up for commish to decide. 
Well damn that was quick
Well depends on other teams but they were at 7 and gonna drop to 10 ish
Well done
Well done
Well done @emyrbot
Well done @The Awbarn Bandwagoner when do you start?!
Well done BC
Well done becker 
Well done Chan
Well done goodwin
Well done Jeff. Nothin like a good LOL pun to give me a hearty chuckle
Well done well done. Some damn good analysis in there, and the Becker paragraphs were the cherry on top 
Well either they’re playing 4D intergalactic chess or they’re lying about his health
Well executed reply Becker 
Well first, congrats on your realization that socialism doesn't work. I don't really have any response to your comments since I don't see much to argue... The part where people are ruined financially, if they have insurance then no problem. If they can't afford it, we have Medicaid, with all its flaws. But what if they choose to not be insured until they get sick? 
Well fortunately for us there’s skin in the game so we actually have a debate winner and not a circular fuckholes argument   
Well fortunately that is an issue left to the board of trustees and not the government.
Well frick me sideways. Looks like my timing was just on the wrong side of that fence 
Well fuck
Well fuck
Well fuck me
Well fuck me i thought it was a national chain and meant "burrito loco"
Well fuck me you're right
Well fuck this shit 
Well fuck. God dammit Nate Diaz
Well good you can have your pick of North Indian or South Indian 
We'll have fun guys
Well he came out of the shadows behind me, attempting to field a bouncing tennis ball yet bobbled in his attempt. I had no choice but to grasp the aforementioned tennis ball and counter with a well placed throw to the wall which he was supposed to touch. The tennis ball made contact with the wall prior to mr beckers fingertip making contact with the wall. And yet, mr Becker maintained that the order of said events was reversed, refusing to accept the predetermined and unanimously accepted punishment. Thus, I cannot help but look upon mr Becker with some degree of skepticism that he'd rather benefit himself than adhere to the very rules that hold our society together
Well he would've helped me on the Murray bet even if he was on waivers...
Well he’s down to +2000
Well he’s not in a league so yeah I’d say so
Well how bout that 
Well I appreciate Andrew Jackson being in this tournament. Came in out of nowhere and immediately made a big impact, winning multiple upsets and even going toe to toe with an original 🐐. Biggest surprise of the tourney so far. 
Well I can’t believe it but apparently the demand for Terrance Williams has skyrocketed in the past 2 years 
Well I certainly know who enforces the mask rules 
Well I did it for the first time yesterday hahaha
Well I don’t clean it by downward dogging in the shower and letting the water shoot into my asshole
Well I don't condone violence against controversial speech, but when Richard Spencer got punched in the face, I was cool with overlooking it.  This falls in a similar boat.
Well I flipped to the Grammys anyway and just saw an incredibly elaborate song and dance performance, didn't realize until the end that it was a target commercial.
Well I guess I can threaten and call the police, but idk what they would do anyway if all I give his his name and social media info
Well I guess in hindsight it was a waste to try give the ANA the weapons to defend themselves in an attempt to end the forever wars. But hey that’s what the Biden administration went with.
Well I guess that little blurb there...
Well I hate it but OBJ under ✅😢
Well I just got my first ever strongly negative performance review 
Well I know how it goes when you have a little D, or worse no D, and I can tell you it doesn't go well. Meanwhile Broncos proved you can win with a big D and little else. 
Well I know that when you go to heaven, St Peter stops you at the pearly gates and asks how many social media likes you got in your lifetime. I need all the groupme hearts I can get
Well I look forward to the fuckhole open part 2
Well I mean that’s #JustFacts✅
Well I personally enjoy the show and am excited for season three
Well I recall in the initial debate, the pro-Nomar argument centered around Nomar capturing the hearts of Boston sports before the pink hat era... Now with that gif of Nomar in a Satan Suit being posted, Joe undermined that whole position. Nomar lost the initial count and the recount, and posting angry links on Facebook doesn't change the outcome
Well I suppose I can say I have the results to prove I gambled wisely, but when you put it like that, it's tough to say "oh I'm just that good at fantasy football" even though it's true
Well I take back the strength of my tone. After watching the line play, its close. Still, Brady on that last drive looked phenomenal and I feel like they win with a few bounces of the ball in a different direction
Well I think dak might suck, but Carr definitely sucks
Well I think people will be a lot more willing to quickly take precautionary measures, and not shrug it off as a big hoax
Well I think the biggest thing is that IT had one more year, Kyrie has 3. Even if you don't think Kyrie is an improvement, that's still huge. Plus Kyrie doesn't have to lead the team offensively, which we all know he sucks at doing. Celtics have a real chance to build something with him and Hayward
Well I took a hard L in the GOP primary so I often don't know shit 
Well i tried 
Well I was like 6th in line for the job, but 1-5 all failed so spectacularly that there was no choice  
Well I was on the fence about eating shit but now I know better
Well I was reading the /r/CFB thread but close enough 
Well I wouldn’t go that far. Also microbubbles prevent concussions
Well I’m not sure exactly, it’s a lot. But the overarching mission is to gather info about the bad guy and how to defeat them
Well I’m super wrong 
Well if all it takes is to tell a narcissist that they have narcissism disorder then maybe the dads expectations aren't crazy
Well if it showed he had a bunch of income from Russian donations that'd be something, but it was only the summary page anyway
Well if it works in Vancouver we should surely try it in the US. I recommend Atlanta as the test city. 
Well if it's a private institution, they can expel you for whatever reason they want (more or less). If it's a public school, it's eventually up to the board of trustees. But no matter what, you cannot be prosecuted by the government for it. 
Well if trump is on the ballot and you didn't vote for Rubio, then you are to blame. 
Well if we move it back a weekend, we can still bond ;)
Well if y'all want to cozy up with a Russian Toad who calls out the worst day of the week then you commies can go the fuck ahead. I'm gonna go hang out with cool ass Wednesday Toad and his dudes
Well if you hopped in that and went back 60 seconds and posted that picture, it would've been perfect
Well if you wanna look together sometime soon I’d love to
Well if you're on the board, you vote him out. I probably would too. There's an implied elastic clause to the whole thing and at that point it's up to the judgement of some rich people who run the school 
Well I'm just gonna send that halfway done since Jeff and Kevin beat me to it
Well I'm seeing more of a live feed than a read everything forum
Well in his defense, that kid might have the best spelling and grammar of any MMA fighter of all time
Well in that case, 2020 doesn't matter and neither did 2016 or 2008 or any election ever 
Well intentioned, sure. But the real world results are horrendous, and unfortunately completely predictable. That's why I was asking about the intricacies of the industry and ideas of a solution, because it's easy to shit on Obamacare but it's near impossible to find a better idea. 
Well is it absurd or not I’m confused
"Well is it good?

I said it’s HOT AND ITS READY"
Well isn't the p value the p value, and the significance threshold is what's arbitrary?
Well it doesn’t seem like there’s a smoking gun. But there were still like 6 indictments. So do with that what you will
Well it obviously depends on what you're trying to predict. If you wrote an algorithm that predicted NASDAQ movements and R2 was .05 and statistically significant, your algorithm would be worth millions. 
Well it sure as hell happened in 2008. I'd barely heard of Obama when he started running
Well it’s an attempt from a semi-organized ideological group to basically take over the government with violence and install their preferred leadership
Well it’s just that Clowney and Watt are such marquee names, sorta like the black diamond of DLs, yet able to be defeated by mediocre white men
Well it's about exactly what I expected. Stage with a megaphone, Lots of hey hey ho ho chants, lots of signs, etc
Well it's not that different really, minus being a bit more liberal in terms of strikes. There is still no direction or end goal strategy anywhere. And with Turkey entering the picture, that could be a problem going forward. I guess I'm glad we're not supporting the "moderate Syrian rebels" as much anymore, despite the cruise missile strikes on the SAA.
Well I've never played organized baseball on a team called the Giants so I guess you got that on me
Well James is almost certainly out so is there someone else who’s not Jeff?
Well January is PCS season so maybe somebody will move out
Well Jeff definitely hates America 
Well John how much do you make as a lyft driver? I'm assuming their business model is near identical
Well Jordy's been a stud so...
Well look at Emyr advocating for the free market 
Well Marcus would argue one person doesn’t change anything, but the anti-vaxers are preventing the US from defeating COVID for good
Well n > 50 for peeing, but n < 20 for the other two.
Well not the quantum part I guess, which afaik has zero operational uses at this point
Well now 2/8
Well now I know why the SEC exists...
Well now it’s a retarded trade but joes right you have to push it through. 
Well now we know why party is cancelled. That dude is prob a scumbag tho once he realized Anesto promoting wasn't working he said fuck him
Well now you spoiled it
Well played Onion
Well prior to 1920, that was absolutely true
Well Saquon was basically as good as an RB can get and the giants still sucked
We'll see if it turns into a Declaration of Independence or more of a bargaining chip. Unclear at the moment, and Barzani has so far expressed that it's the latter, at least publically
Well see if that matters
Well sheeeeeeeit I guess I have no choice
Well shit can’t really argue with that
Well shit guys guess it’s this from now on
Well shit I cannot think of a better reason to allow the trade now
Well shit Kyrie
well shit Marcus spittin straight facts 
Well shit now they better get married
Well shit Steph is never gonna live that one down
Well shucks
Well since he can’t enforce a curfew, I imagine he is setting up a night time focused “recommended curfew” and hope social shaming works
Well since the league is set up all you have to do is ensure 10 members, set a draft time, take control of the spreadsheet, set keepers, and write LM notes. If you can do that, you'll have my vote.
Well so much for the Kawhi-Lamarcus-Russ Spurs super team 
Well so much for working on the job hunt 
Well sometimes you're born to an important family and you're gonna inherit winter fell or something and your parents use your marriage to broker political relationships 
Well technically it's "Johnny Utah's"
Well tell that bitch to hurry up
Well that number is contingent on the rest of the states who haven't voted yet. I honestly have no clue what his "target" is, but I'd expect that your number is probably pretty close, maybe a bit low actually. 
Well that sucked
Well that sucks
Well that was a roller coaster of events right there
Well that was the gayest shit I’ve ever seen
Well that’s not a constructive statement
Well that's a big part of why Don is getting lambasted now. Never showed any restraint attacking Muslim terrorists, Obama, Hilldog, CNN, the New York Times, MS13, or even Rosie fucking O'Donnell. But all of a sudden he can't do it with White Supremacists
Well thats a US constitutional right. I would not say that’s a universal human right 
Well that's actually not one of the categories, link skimmer. He's most likely to not change from "all around perimeter", but inch closer to "low usage all around"
Well that's exactly the point. Managers realized their shit was shit, told traders to get it off the books. Ratings agencies (aka the govt) rated these things as good when they were shit. Traders sold the assets at way overpriced values. Shit hit the fan, anybody who bought one was screwed. So who's fault is it? 
Well the best doctors get the best doctor jobs. The less good doctors get the less good doctor jobs. And the future Kelleher Plan doctors (who don't have to go through the same rigorous and expensive med school process and more) get the Kelleher Plan jobs
Well the government spying on people is illegal
Well the insurance company pays it, right?
Well the whole point of the article is saying that the deflategate punishment was too harsh because the spy gate punishment was too light, so that's why they're bringing it up lol
Well then
Well then fuck you you're not wanted
Well then I hope todays conversation has been useful ( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼
Well then I nominate Chan 
Well then it’s been fucking stupid since 2013
Well then it’s guaranteed that Rosen will outplay Murray this season
Well then more of us donate than I thought... but not much more than I thought 
Well then neither are the bullets?
Well then you can get revenge by telling Jenn Howard specifically which people are going to Canton MA for a mini reunion 
Well then you're wrong
Well there goes our last remaining shred of offensive potential
Well there goes that conspiracy theory
Well there is a multi-state haji hunt going on...
Well there ya go
Well they’re not tooooo far apart in fantasy ROS IMO
Well they're clearly doing it on purpose. They know SF has taken so much happiness from the rest of the nation in baseball and basketball over the past 6 years, so they've chosen to donate some back out of sheer good will. I know this because when the Niners accidentally lost against the Seahawks last year, our noble owner apologized for the mistake. Same thing happens this year, yet no apology.
Well this fight is depressing
Well this has been a fun 4 minutes
Well this problem is the reason Plato said that democracy the 2nd worst form of government (right @The Awbarn Bandwagoner?) I'm trying to think of ways to ameliorate that problem without ending democracy instead of just saying "there are zero solutions"
Well tldr there’s a big meta discussion about the ethics of AI in general, manifesting in trying to discover and break ChatGPT’s response safeguards
Well unfortunately Cruz can't easily win (538 has a damn good article as to why; I'll link below). But yes agree that all people hear is Trump Trump Trump, thanks to the piece of shit media that is FOX news, CNN, and MSNBC.
Well using your numbers. Brady is a 50% shot if the pats lose, and a 90% shot if the pats win. The odds of those events is 50:50, so him winning MVP would be a 70% chance. So 70% x 50% is a 35% chance of both instances occurring, which im gonna round to 2:1 odds, then take a bit off the top for the casino and call it 9:5
Well well well 
Well what was it
Well what were we offering him??
Well what's your solutions buckaroos?
Well when you put it that way now I'm gonna match Becker on BC winning 9 games!! Everything I know is pretty much just skimmed from Twitter or BCI, so I usually don't know the full story
Well with the Beatdown in Beantown and the Fuckholes Open, that's true. But hopefully that person won't back out of Fantasy Fuckholes too
Well yeah that's the whole point of insurance. But idk why they make shit cost so much, then push the cost on to the insurers, who push the cost onto the consumer
Well yes because you wouldn’t have to cancel the games, so this whole discussion wouldn’t exist...
Well you can have fields or fatboi
Well, before Barry or Barry?
Well, besides the fact he endorsed trump. But I guess he didn't have much of a choice... Senators don't have to endorse, but Speaker of the House pretty much has to
Well, define "young" I guess
Well, depends on my needs
Well, do I play the hand I’m dealt or do I chase the “from the river to the sea” populist message that the people want? If the former doesn’t get me assassinated by Hamas, then we have to cut the violence, beg the US and UN for money, and turn our limited neighborhoods into economic and cultural successes to be proud of. 
Well, everybody hates Obama actually. He has shown very little support of the alliances that Clinton and Bush established. He's much more pro-world community than pro US-UK community, for example. He's also incredibly unpredictable, and he has a tendency to say one thing and do another. Not good for alliances at all. 
Well, how much is it worth then? Especially considering you already are the director of a major motion picture with a massive marketing budget
Well, least to talk about on Reddit for sure lol
Well, many/most people search on kayak or something. And if a flight is $25 cheaper than another, people click that one
Well, maybe. Still no confirmations yet
Well... How do you deal with boners?
Well?
Well? 
Welp almost got into a fight last night. Went out to the party section where everybody is in the street, literally don’t know what I did and all of a sudden I get a whack in the back of the head. Turn around fucking furious and it’s this Asian girl and she had tomahawked me with a bamboo mug. So obviously I can’t punch a girl but this chick launches the mug at me and proceeds to throw a bunch of hilarious girl punches, and I’m just standing there very confused. One of the girls got in front of her and she stormed off. Nobody could figure out what I did wrong. But somebody saw the same girl later trying to start a fight with someone else
Welp apparently that settles the coldness debate
Welp boys I’ve officially reported to Holloman AFB in shithole NM, where I’ll probably be for the next 2-3 years. Wish my mental health good luck
Welp doomed to be an instafailure then
Welp Emyr you get to say I told you so
Welp first game of HQ and I lost on the second question lmao
Welp for the second consecutive Sunday y’all have made groupme incredibly entertaining so thanks fuckholes 
Welp fuck me. Well done groupme 
Welp good thing we didn’t plan the draft for today

Welp guess I have to hate DJ now
Welp I failed my drug test...
Welp i fell for it. Well done well done
Welp I just finished my last shift at Asgard. Shout out to all of you who came and had a beer 
Welp I just went to a ladyboy show and got sexually assaulted literally 14 Times so goody I guess you’d be Proud of me 
Welp i spent 5 minutes skimming through the BC DSA account runner and wow, what a guy...
Welp i suppose the US response could be worse
Welp I’m a Jon Rahm stan now
Welp I'm likely to be first out in survivor 
Welp Im sure you’ll be good friends with lots of bugs bunny’s and naked cowboys
Welp looks like I’ll never be putting this great advice to use. What a shame. Should’ve led with this
Welp my 3 worst teams in the league are 2-0-1 #guru
Welp my trip hath come to an end. On the bright side I get to return to the United States so it’s not ll bad
Welp not a great start
Welp now it is haha
Welp nvm 
Welp on a big picture level, the Blue Wave is turning out to be a pipe dream. They can/should still win the house, but they’re doing poorly in most tossup races. And the only upset so far was Donnelly, a Dem, losing a senate seat 
Welp one of our 🐐s goes down. Andrew Jackson finna be kicked of the back of the bills
Welp that was bad by Jones
Welp the Pats clearly overestimated the WR market prices 
Welp the 🐐 title just lost all of its prestige and meaning
Welp this guy is my new favorite red sock immediately
Welp trump said he'll care about black brown and white people. @Chancy Reagan We're fucked
Welp unless we reset for goodwin and somehow convince Jeff, I guess we’re stuck with an 8 man league
Welp we made it 0 games into the baseball season without a Covid postponement 
Welp. It was close for 2 quarters, which is 2 quarters longer than I expected
Wembley Stadium is the most British sounding name hahaha

We're also alluding to but not explicitly mentioning electability. If I think this way about Cruz, how will on-the-fence voters feel about him?
We're any of the above 1-10?
We're any teams near as strong an outlier as the raiders?
We're at Bobby V's watching BC now

We're taking the landlord to small claims court 
We're talking about hidden boutique food shops, ice cream and dishwashing. When did the Fuckholes become a bunch of women?
Were there any illuminating halftime coach interviews in the Auburn NMSU game? Surely an such an unexpected and impactful situation yielded some uniquely insightful segments.
We're up to 21-19-3, not including terrorists or JJ Watr
Weren’t you gonna mind your own damn business?

Work 10-14 hours a day, no days off. It’s really not easy to have the motivation to go to the gym, or god forbid run
Work out as a team, make it seem like there's a goal, do some cool looking workouts, dominate social media... charge $200 per month
World Baseball Classic was amazing this year. Anybody who calls them self a baseball fan and didn't watch it really missed out
World power, however they define it
Worse than when Marcus beat you on No. 2?
Worst case scenario is that 90% of Afghanistan falls to the taliban, and then shortly falls to ISIS-K. And that scenario is not particularly low probably 
Worst Christmas card of the year
Worst ending ever 
"Worst fan bases:
Yankees
Eagles
Chargers
Raiders
Heat (Lebron Era)

Worst game of the season
Worst groupme member 
"Worst groupme participant power rankings:
1) Marcus
T2) 11-way tie"
worst loss of JJ's life
Worst non-Gase coaching in the league 
Worst part is if I started Tyrod I might've had a legit shot
Worst part? Not a single one of these frauds has a good LOL name pun
worst player: jorge garcia
Worst power rankings ever
Worst recap I've ever read
"Worst sports teams power rankings:
1) Dodgers"
"Worst:
Browns

Would be a hilarious week for the AFC south
Would be a shame if I had to hate Rickie too
Would be a sure fire way to lose my extremely generous bookie
"Would be an awesome connection between Sanders and... 

*checks notes*... 

Jarret Stidham"
Would be feel right fleecing you like that
Would be tough to do for rural areas
Would having a basket case like her be a bad thing
Would it be called a “pommelier” 🤔 
Would it be fucked up to require some kind of basic test before allowing people to vote? Like you need to be able to do 3rd grade math and read (in any language) at a 3rd grade level. 
Would like some quality checking eventually
Would like to see the Top 4 because CFB is certainly even more lopsided
Would literally rather hang out with marika 
Would love a searchme of all the Elon posts some day
Would love if Lynch and Shanny are pulling straight mind games with the league. Would hate it if they weren’t 
Would love to see him suddenly switch sides on this issue. It would be an incredible hezi crossover
Would love to see the correlation with spreads 
Would she race in the men’s or women’s division?
Would that make him a Freemason?
Would want them next year too, but definitely this year. If you bail now after agreeing, see ya
Would yall change your minds if I told you those 3 movies are extremely popular?
Would you bet over/under 60% chance Bama or Clemson wins it all?
Would you go again? Aka is it worth trying to go in 2023?
Would you have made Jimmy Carter sell his peanut farm?
Would you prefer “he put on 20 pounds. We hope most of it is muscle”
Would you prefer a day or night shift 
Would you prefer me say "we dont raise second place banners, we raise championship banners" and then hire Jim Tomsula?
Would you prefer she be #1?
Would you put bama in the Peach Bowl?
Would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Would you rather bite off one of your own fingers or give DJ Khaled an hourlong rimjob?
Would you rather do that, or go 9 months without thinking about quitting once?
Would you rather get a massage from a man, or surgery from a female doctor?
Would you rather go to a gym full of treadmill walkers or a gym full of cross fitters?
Would you rather have the Pats locker room or Giants locker room rn?
Would you rather lose to UConn as 14 point favorites or as 3 point underdogs
Would you rather play an easy then tough season schedule, or tough then easy?
Would you rather sit on a cake and eat a dick, or sit on a dick and eat a cake
Would you rather sit on a cake and eat a dick, or sit on a dick and eat a cake?
"Would you rather: Thousands of infections vs $30 off a flight

Future doctor: The latter, no brainer"

Have BC win it’s bowl game

Would you say he’s like a 7-5 kinda guy?
Would you say it’s more about drive or more about power?
Would you say it's because of our conversation?!
Would you say this is closer to your ideal housing community?
Would you say you’re more stressy or depressy this week?
Would you take -5?
Would. Bonk / Haha. 
Would’ve loved to see manningcast on that play
Wouldn’t affect my decision. Fuck public opinion
Wouldn’t be great for us BC fans
Wouldn’t be surprised if that was the case though. Rings last forever 
Wouldn’t be surprised if the football team is disproportionately marines
Wouldn’t Denver want to keep him if they want to entice cousins
Wouldn’t draft him for $11 tho lmao 
Wouldn’t it be better to know that im ensuring I don’t knock up and alamogordita?
Wouldn’t know, don’t have tinder 
Wouldn’t know. I never go into my local department store, only Ross
Wouldn’t that be literally the same as popular vote?
Wouldn’t that just make customers deposit the limit in multiple banks?
Wouldn’t this mean shorter names are better??
Wouldn’t you just take the under 7.5 becker offered 
Wouldn't be the first time you've had 5 guys down your throat
Wouldn't believe it for a second 
Wouldn't have called this in 100 years, but I'll take it hahaha
"wouldnt it be:
Sensitivity = True Pos / (True Pos + False Neg)
Specificity = True Neg / (True Neg + False Pos)"
Wouldn't surprise me
Wouldn't that mean things like AHANA, and affirmative action?
Wouldn't they be the incumbent?
Wouldn't those things just create massive cost sinkholes for the hospitals?

Wow crazy It works on Facebook too
Wow DENOUNCE
Wow didn't even see the parallels until now but that's exactly what he did with SecDef chuck hagel. Hagel said we can't pull out of Iraq because the Taliban will come back, Obama said no were pulling out because I want to, Hagel said no, bad idea, will make the world a worse place. Obama says ok well you're fired, pulls out, and is now going back. Great President.

Wow just passing a golden opportunity here
Wow just read the post. Yeah that’s super suspicious if the post is accurate 
Wow literally not one positive reply

Wow surprising fact: first super bowl matchup between 2 QBs who were both #1 overall picks
Wow that article is actual trash. Not surprised from the clownshow New York Times 
Wow that chiefs play

Wow that is garbage 
Wow that is terrible
Wow that was a brutal failed 3-1 for UCLA 
"Wow that was easy,

Wow that was one sided
wow that was quick haha
Wow that was such horseshit
Wow that would've been highway robbery but still can't veto unless collusion
Wow that’s a good deal
Wow that’s a good line
Wow that’s a hot take but honestly I’m here for it
Wow that’s a whole nother level of masochism  
Wow that’s Aaron judge in the playoffs level
Wow that’s actually perfect Jeff
Wow that’s almost as bad as GiLOLants
Wow that’s amazing hahaha
Wow that’s insensitive. I might go on a 15 minute tirade against you 
Wow that’s possibly the most sociopathic idea I’ve ever had
Wow that’s terrible by the refs
Wow that’s tough
Wow that’s way worse than this last cop shooting stance or the genocide handwaving
Wow that's a Jamie level bitch move
Wow that's petty
Wow the bucks are boycotting their game
Wow the dirtiest athlete ever right next to Ric Flair!!
Wow the players are shitting on the US Open pretty hard. When you get Matt Fitzpatrick verbally displeased you know you did something wrong
Wow the plot thickens...
Wow the replay review insider broadcast was actually awesome 
Wow there are fans
Wow they literally got Alabama, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut wrong...
"Wow they’re not messing around
"

Wow. Never seen more of a fix against the Pats than on this play
Wow. No pomp and circumstance whatsoever. Sad. 
Wow. Pac12 is actually dead. 
Wow. Spoiler alert. 
Wow. That is dangerous 
Wow. The field of dreams game was straight out of a movie. Absolutely incredible.

Ya but what's cooler, having your girlfriend come into your bumblefuck apartment and having slow boring sex while Netflix is on, or marching down from the top of a snowy mountain with your big mountain man dick, sweeping your lady off her feet and having her right where she stands.
Ya funny story about that, I have a drug test for this Amex project within the next 2 weeks. Literally my only hope is they don't test for THC...
Ya hahaha talk about trying to compare stats and even players from earlier years. The few hundred players who played in both eras would be critically analyzed.
Ya he blows
Ya he British 
Ya he was a can't miss high school talent who every college passed on because of his DV conviction
Ya his speech tho damn...
Ya I have to do it
Ya I just realized that too. I was looking at their old rotation. But it's not like it's any better

Y'all are bonkers. Playoffs make sooo much more sense than no playoffs in every sport
Y'all are fools. The guy is a legend. He's also never been a criminal or done anything wrong with his actions. Hall of Famer, no douvt
Y'all are letting Goody take over the Survivor Pool while it should be Joe taking over FFL commissionership. This is wrong. 
Yall are so extra
Y'all are some haters
Y'all are very close 
Y'all are wrong. 2 dudes + 2 chicks swapping is like the definition of an orgy

Y'all were right. Antifa took credit for the banner
Y'alls avatars are creepy
"Yan is good and also is far from washed up, but I think Cejudo would wipe the floor with him. Also Aldo took like 2 whole minutes of unnecessary Beatdown at the end

Holloway got robbed. Great fight though.

Usman is so boring. Clinch and footstomps I literally cannot think of a more boring style. "
Yankee stadium attendance is a joke. The real fans all live too far to attend.
Yankees are prob gonna sign chapman right back
Yankees Dodgers seems inevitable. Big loss for America 
Yankees fans blow too though
"Yankees
Cowboys
Lakers / Heat with LBJ
Duke
ND"
Yankees, Cardinals, Giants
Yassssss hahaha flex on the little leaguers
Yay Bama and Duke 
Yay disagreement!
Yay I did my first shift and didn’t suck
yay im getting vaccinated 22 jan
Yay no need to get a job ever
Yay we are above average politicogeographers
Yaz is right!
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah 4 firsts is probably closer to the minimum tbh
Yeah 7500 across all teams for the whole season 
Yeah 9 was a sleeper because you might get some wild convos and also probably wipe the floor with them
Yeah a salary floor is probably not a bad idea
Yeah a ton of homegrown talent anchoring the team like Shohei, Freeman, Mookie, Yamamoto. Definitely not built on $100 million signings everywhere 
"Yeah across the board too. Fox, quinnipiac, PPP, Ipsos all had Biden up:
FL 3-4
MI 7-8
PA 6-8
WI 3-5"
Yeah actually Chan had a great point. what the fuck Becker 
Yeah actually probably not a bad place for that. If they like you and you like them, they'd bring you back after grad school without hesitation 
Yeah agree in this case. Funny because that's usually their strong suit 
Yeah all I remember is Bush Gore and Nader
Yeah all signs are pointing to Cora getting a bigger punishment than hinch 
Yeah and also you messed the seeds up lol
Yeah and he basically admitted he endorsed Trump because Trump would name him his VP, after talking about Jesus and about his selflessness for months. What a douche nozzle
Yeah and his fights looked like scenes from the matrix
Yeah and his wife knows her place which is why he's better than curry
Yeah and I had to spend all my money from the night on that Latin dance club next door to seal the deal 
Yeah and I need it tbh. Might’ve gotten diabetes over 2 weeks. Them Thai folks fucking love sugar
Yeah and I read each one and looked forward to the next. So did millions of children across America. Fuck outta here. 
Yeah and I remember thinking that was all hype. Dumbass lol
Yeah and I signed up for Obamacare too
Yeah and I think the deep and widespread dislike of GWB coinciding with the rise of social media was the start of it, and it keeps spiraling out of control
Yeah and if it was it would be 151
Yeah and that loan solution is high rates for worse students. It puts a huge onus on 14 year olds. 
Yeah and the area around JBAB is the fucking hold
Yeah and they beat the Niners in the super bowl. I remember 
Yeah and they got flamed for it
Yeah and they jumped for zero
Yeah and you undermined your legitimate point with the flawed extended logic bit, but yes I see the problems. All im trying to do is think of potential solutions so that the people who have a say in the future of the country and world are the people who care about the future of the country and the world 
Yeah and you’d expect those pick swaps to be super late too, so probably not exercised
Yeah anybody who goes out of their way to social media post defending Palestine right now is probably a mega weirdo. Its not that hard to just not post anything
Yeah anybody who says they don’t have concerns is lying. Even the preseason reports were mixed when they’re supposed to anoint him as the second coming
Yeah bag it. Sad day for us libtards
Yeah because of the talent compared to the NBA. That's not the leagues fault. If anything the NBA is doing a lot more for the G league than it "deserves" on the market
Yeah because they have a significantly smaller welfare state
Yeah Becker that was hilarious haha
Yeah Becker wtf man
Yeah becker YOU have the worst luck this year. Fuck outta here
Yeah best picture I think
Yeah better than banning it outright. I get the argument tho
YEAH BITCH
Yeah BITCH
Yeah bitch
Yeah bitch 
Yeah Boston is way simpler layout than NYC
Yeah but 40s are really tough to time manually. It was probably more like 4.15
Yeah but can I go to the gym and practice before I say ok it’s time for my one shot, one opportunity
Yeah but difficultly doesn’t really matter if you’re not punished for your shots 
Yeah but he also claims he didn't deflate any footballs so we know how easily lies roll off his tongue
Yeah but he was doing that when he was knocking fools around too
Yeah but I already called them Jews so I didn't wanna be redundant
Yeah but I bet the real life KDR or wolves to rats is higher than 222:1
Yeah but I don’t get a single warm up shot. I think I’m like 20% corner 3 with 5 mins of warmup
Yeah but I want that on repeat running through his head 
Yeah but I'd expect salaries to be similar anyway
Yeah but if he hits .350 guarantee that fatness would be quickly overlooked
Yeah but if you get a tattoo of Chinese characters you can actually know what it means instead of trusting the tattoo artist
Yeah but it does allow for the cheapest tickets
Yeah but it has the best Toad 
Yeah but it’s not good either
Yeah but it’s not over saturated for those who’ve never played it
Yeah but it's difficult for me to consider myself an intelligent person and also play the lottery
Yeah but looking at the rest of the draft. There's diamond in the rough Jokic, Julius Randle, Elfrid Payton, and nobody else who id want over Smart
Yeah but neither do the Niners (beathard almost certainly not gonna be a factor next season) but who cares. Rebuild and go for it in 2
Yeah but Obama said ISIS is contained and is a JV team and our current strategy is working, so there's no need to be worried
Yeah but Philly has six. Seven if you include the airport. 
Yeah but that’s 3 less years the world has a Jeff Savarino so net benefit to everyone really
Yeah but that's just Spanish where the ñ is an nh and they pronounce the Js
Yeah but there’s Joe who hates addazio but still roots for BCs success. Then there’s the rest of y’all who would blow up Alumni Stadium if it meant addazio leaves. 
Yeah but they're erect, not flaccid
Yeah but they're getting "better", as are the other sports. Meanwhile soccer is actively anti-statistics for whatever reason
Yeah but this chat isn’t actively monitored by our fucking bosses
Yeah but This is literally what she signed up for 
Yeah but those cost money  
Yeah but wasn't he supposed to be like 250 years old?
Yeah but Watson doesn't love to kiss titties, or at least not enough to say "hey this is a good tweet". So trubisky still has the upper hand
Yeah but what happens if they treat us to a Chinese restaurant and don't give forks
Yeah but who would ever use #Joe
Yeah but y’all assume they were always progress, and go nuts when they regress, when though it happens all the time. A young player has a good season and everybody declares it their floor 
Yeah but you cheated so if you're sleeping soundly that means you're going to hell
Yeah but you have a new best GM so things could be quite different
Yeah but you knew that already
Yeah but you won anyway so fuck you
Yeah but you're basically sure you're gonna be right
Yeah can’t find that hotel online
Yeah Canada has the strongest preventative border in the history of the world
Yeah Chris are you trolling?
"Yeah CMT is unlikely for Boston. HPS and FS are the most common. I'd guess FS just because of your CSOM
background"
Yeah confirmed just now
Yeah DC is my top choice actually
Yeah dude principled conservatism appears dead right now. The GOP has gone full populist, and the Dems have been doing the same for years. Neither party supports things like free trade and personal accountability anymore. My hope was that there would be a bipartisan call to unite in moderation against Trump, but there are no signs of that so far. 
Yeah Education pseudonym is 7th
Yeah especially after those two bullshit PIs that led to the Dolphins only score
Yeah everything’s fine, thanks for asking
Yeah exactly. And I got to name somebody going SoBo so that was cool too
Yeah except the change from snake to auction makes a huge difference...
Yeah except this Dynasty is a different set of players every year
Yeah feel like that’s the only way you can do it
Yeah figured you did. But the effort is just not worth it lol
Yeah first glimpse of katahdin from there
Yeah first point is what I thought but I'm not gonna check his math. Second point I still don't get. What incentive does a university have to lower the cost of waived tuition if the tax burden falls on the grad student who is willing to pay it?
Yeah first time it always works, then usually never again haha
Yeah Fitz > T Bow since Fitz went to Harvard and he'd agree with me that the seed matchup bug is an egregious error that must be fixed. Meanwhile Timmy T would've said some shit like "Oh 3v5 is a sign from God that we should be thinking about the message in Matthew 3:5"
Yeah Flacco for sure since he got a ring. Idk if titans fans would say they are glad they drafted Tanny 
Yeah for the first time in his life, Kapernick is being the most reasonable party
Yeah Goody that's called Cap and Trade, pretty popular amongst climate change advocates. Problem with all this stuff is of course that it's essentially another tax on businesses, and in turn their workers. Adding more regulation and fining factories for pollution hurts workers. 
Yeah gotta be. Can't think of anybody else who's close honestly. Palmer mayyyybe but not after last game. 
Yeah he could be better. But we’re BC, and we’re the best we’ve been in a while. You guys are insatiable. 
Yeah he does do that a lot. I really wanna see him in a system where he doesn't have to do fucking everything though. I think he has all the tools to be very very good
Yeah he had a bad Linjury
Yeah he kept a bench player and has no QBs as a result
Yeah he makes boneheaded in game decisions but still let’s stop pretending he’s Spaz
Yeah he possesses the intangible of needing to leave so his team can finally win
Yeah he should be getting his insights exclusively from r/fantasy football
Yeah he was really rude to everyone. That's why they called him Rudy
Yeah he’s got the negative publicity thing down. I hate him already
Yeah he’s nowhere near as bad as hue but he literally couldnt possibly be worse even despite his extremely low expectations 
Yeah her mom still is a teacher there I think. She went there.
Yeah he's a good looking piece of shit
Yeah he's all about his legacy at this point, which he's attempting to establish with a ridiculous set of hundreds of Principles about running a business / leading life
Yeah he's somehow managed to avoid that for the most part this time. Maybe it's the applause every 10 seconds that prevents him from rambling
Yeah his field vision in the pocket and decision making has been repeatedly poor too often. I still think the Bills offense was overall good, def top 10, probably higher
Yeah house buying is probably the way to go
Yeah I actually feel like that's a good way to eliminate a shitty girl, or confirm that she's cool 
Yeah I agree, my theory is that if a slider and 2 seamer are the same speed, it makes it harder to hit. They did say in the article that for individual pitches, there were 5 metrics for success (4 seam vertical movement, curveball horizontal movement, etc), and that there was no difference in getting more movement from lower spin rate.
Yeah I am confused at Strava 
Yeah I bet you love to suck on this dick Andes NUTS!
Yeah I can believe it
Yeah I can call the cops, call his school, etc. Go on Reddit and call him out could be the most effective. I want to get the money back
Yeah I can feel my shirt boxers and pants getting all tangled up just thinking about doing that. Discomfort for the rest of the day. No thank you. 
Yeah I can’t say I have either but it’s on Wikipedia lol
Yeah I can’t see a ton of messages and clicking unhorse messages doesn’t work
Yeah I can't stand Milo or Crowder tbh, even though they're good at shutting up SJWs. 
Yeah I could be interested. I don't do shit like that enough
Yeah i did once. Not worth it at all.
Yeah I didn’t even skim, I skipped. You think it should be more in favor of the pats?
Yeah I didn't like it either but his post debate recovery on it has been good. He basically doubled down and said "yes, I believe that and it needs to be said 4 times and it needs to be said more because it's true and it's a key point of my campaign"
Yeah I do too unfortunately :(
Yeah I don’t buy it. Brady’s been in the league for like 50 years and never once had an allegation of something like that
Yeah I don’t get why the pats didn’t make this trade. It cost basically nothing
Yeah I don’t love the bar graph. I would love a line graph type thing showing receipt over time
Yeah I don’t think I’ll be able to afford a house. Probably a condo and mayyyybe a townhouse. 
Yeah I don’t think this elevated the rep of LACC lol
Yeah I don't get it?
Yeah I feel like Drake shit will last
Yeah I feel like it's almost common sense. Yet I get the vibe the White Sox are coming out of this looking like the villains 
Yeah I gonna say haha. That transliteration is not mando
Yeah I got good things going. I’ll tell you tomorrow
Yeah I guess >50% chance 
Yeah I guess he'd be a good source for locker room insights and the like. Still an idiot with his analysis tho
Yeah I guess I could root for the raiders at least. NE would have to root for buffalo
Yeah I guess I’m for that. I think im just straight up anti tipping at this point so let the “operating fees” continue 
Yeah I guess. I wouldnt read too much into it. The point is that Faiz continues to rack up the points  
Yeah I have access to the Internet. I've seen it
Yeah I have no idea 
Yeah I ignored yesterday because the vaccine talk was retarded (just like vaccinated kids are)
Yeah I invented packaging a call option as part of a trade, where you trade a player, but also pay auction $ for the option to bring back that player in the off-season as a potential keeper
Yeah I just discovered it yesterday 
Yeah I just googled. DVOA (basically team WAR) is a Football Outsiders stat. Didn't read about what goes into it but it's probably a decent proxy at a high level
Yeah I just watched the vid. He was just guessing he's had about 10 before but I think this was his first in a professional game
Yeah I know haha. They're part of the same set of baseball trivia 
Yeah I know they're being told everything they already know, but still the energy and attitude is huge
Yeah I know which makes me hate Jon Jones for the multiple DUIs even more
Yeah I know y’all don’t hang out in Cambridge but I figured I’d ask
Yeah I know you're all about the audio commentary 
Yeah I know. I needed to see the container tho
Yeah I know. It's flabbergasting
Yeah I know. That's why you just... Let them go... And not treat the policy like the Word of God incarnate... 
Yeah I legit only could think of 3 Negro league players: those two and Willie Mays
Yeah I like fish sticks
Yeah I love how he refers to her as "very very VIP" lmao 
Yeah I made damn sure of that lol
Yeah I made way less than that
Yeah I mean he appears to be bipolar and maybe more. But the pathological lying and defending the 4.4 40, the party with Chris Brown, and the Lambo are too good. And of course there's the dancing and football highlight videos. And the #WCWs. And the constant imploring of everybody to pay attention to what he does. It's all too good...
Yeah I need Emz and Darrow to keep winning and the other contenders to keep losing. 
Yeah I noticed that after the first few days
Yeah I only played gens 1 and 2 and am vaguely familiar with 4 (I think, it had penguins as the water starters)
Yeah I pretty much agree with all of that
Yeah I remember. And Joe was by far best of you three. 
Yeah I respectfully disagree with that train of thought. One, there are just so many moving pieces that it’s impossible to predict at all. Two, I don’t buy the logic that intervening in WWI sooner would stop a russian revolution (delay it probably), or result in non-intervention in the future.
Yeah I said iPhone at first but then it’s really not worth it to spend $400 more for just iMessages
Yeah I saw im sad
Yeah I saw it on shark tank. I hope nobody uses it
Yeah I saw that clip lol
Yeah I saw this. Nobody seems to have any idea what it is
Yeah I saw. I read that they were using tickets meant for family of crewmembers (or some non-commercial ticket). Those tickets have dress codes, which leggings didn't adhere to or something
Yeah I see that. Atlantic has good stuff though. I like that guy David Frum a lot
Yeah I skimmed that whole conversation so what is it
Yeah I think he had 2 fumbles and he was shaky receiving punts. I would've wanted him to try KR when he actually might have room but never got a shot
Yeah I think I agree with you. They’re in a real tough spot because they can’t even come close financially with the Saudis and they know it. So they have the history and prestige of the PGA and that’s pretty much it
Yeah I think I can rub it out ;) Id have to not JO for a few days before, then wake up and immediately rub one out, take another quick nap and JO again upon waking. Repeat. Basically trying to get halfway there ASAP 
Yeah I think I could break par. Assuming you just put down another ball and hit it. Basically means all high quality shots and really doesn’t take any extra time 
Yeah I think I do that too. Man that's gross. But otherwise it basically ruins all your relationships forever 
Yeah I think I have to
Yeah I think I take the under up to about -180
Yeah I think it has to be this too. Maybe +300?
Yeah I think it will be significant. I think there will be a high likelihood that remote work is a permanent option for folks who want it. Also there’s an incentive for companies since they can save a boatload on floor space rental/ownership
Yeah I think it’s like the Baseball Hall of Fame. We all shit on it but we all still sorta care 
Yeah I think so lol
Yeah I think that's the cover? A cricket and a mouse or something eating liverwurst in the subway
Yeah I think the most serious players all play dynasty. It's as if you're not serious if you don't play dynasty
Yeah I think the NFL WRs would still dominate 
Yeah I think these guys all have to have coaching jobs or something in the offseason
Yeah I think they could
Yeah I think you've read more GoT than I have with all the time you've spent on the wiki hahahaha 
Yeah I thought it was a joke lmao
Yeah I thought it was pretty remarkable
Yeah I thought that was interesting too, as if they're expecting negative coverage... Wonder how that number changes if you conducted this survey 1 year ago
Yeah I totally didn't read anything before guessing that ;)
Yeah I was considering all options. But I did know that I couldn’t work in consulting/finance my whole life purely for the paycheck so I knew something needed to change 
"Yeah I was gonna say Marcus maybe -200 ish. 

I’d estimate I’m shooting 95-100"
Yeah I was gonna say that’s a Sisyphean task
Yeah I was gonna say they're def getting a special teams TD, probably a few FGs from turnovers...
Yeah I was really upset, and I still remember it so vividly. He did a outside leg standup with his neck down, I faked an ankle ride and snatched it and had it locked up, and halfway through my pass to his farside leg I just fell backward right into a headlock and got pinned. Mortifying. 
Yeah I was super into Bloody Elbow a few years back. And the lead baseball guy is a Giants fan so I still love that. But like the front page article has been about Kaepernick for about a month now, they incessantly lecture about Title IX and NC HB2, and scold everybody who calls the Redskins the Redskins. So I'm getting pretty sick of it. 
Yeah i was thinking we all just go to black rose or something
Yeah I went to Heidelberg today
Yeah I went to the castle 
Yeah I would see the fuck out of a Beyoncé concert. It's not like it's One Direction or some shit
Yeah I would take that bet too lmao
Yeah I wouldn’t be surprised
Yeah I wouldn’t put Clemson in the top 10
Yeah I wouldn't let him start next inning
Yeah I’d put it at 30%
Yeah I’d say >50%
Yeah I’ll bet $20 that Winston isn’t a top 10 QB average weeks 12-16
Yeah I’m 100% for it. My semi-informed take (parroting Nate silver and other neoliberal tweeters) is that the earliest phases should be straight up by highest risk of death
Yeah I’m accepting the big L at this point 😔 
Yeah I’m all in for Biden. I don’t understand that mindset Drachman?
Yeah I’m down for pizza 
Yeah I’m pretty similar
Yeah I’ve read that. Where does that stipulation come from??
Yeah I'd like to talk about it if any of y'all watch too
Yeah idc the guest shit is so forced
Yeah idk how it’s even in the same category as most of these
Yeah idk just in no world am I barely clearing 200
Yeah idk what I was thinking. Over under 10 is probably more accurate
Yeah idk why they’re making such a big deal of being 12 behind the record 
Yeah if he gets ClintonEd you win
Yeah if the player was traded it skews the numbers 
Yeah if you think potentially being paid in 3 years is good enough for bringing in millions to another organization, were just not gonna agree
Yeah if you want to do it and it doesn't hurt anybody else, you should have the right. 
Yeah I'm confused...
Yeah I'm glad we're all on the same page about that asshole tattletale Mike LaPointe 
Yeah I'm going long for sure, so I'm not worried about small things. Just wondering if it's too risky to double down now
Yeah I'm not happy about it
Yeah I'm personally for defunding it after looking at their books (they profited $127MM last year) but it's never going to happen, so I'm gonna pick my battles and let this one slide
Yeah I'm pretty anti minimum wage raise as you guys might have expected. It's enacting the very definition of inflation in certain locations. The people who are hurt by it most are small business owners who suddenly see their labor costs rise 50%. The people hurt by it second most are the workers who would've been hired for $9, but won't be hired for $15. Ironically, giant corporations are going to be the ones who can most afford this raise, and though it hurts their profits in the short run, it's not a life threatening cost like it is for small firms.
Yeah I'm pretty sure they've made the post season every single year since then
Yeah I'm staying with TPatches
Yeah im still unconvinced that BC is becoming a better school, but I suppose that has more to do with my own priorities contrasting with theirs than anything else
Yeah I'm super down with the Feds funding climate change research
Yeah I'm sure any stat worth its salt would account for that. And Goody there are several ESPN shorts that beg to differ that sports don't make the world better
Yeah I'm trying to figure that out now. BE comments are saying they test sample A, then if there are positive results, they test Sample B and C to confirm, then they release. Still don't know why that takes 3 weeks but yeah
Yeah in that case might as well. No downside in doing that 
Yeah Iran is a huge supporter of violent militias in Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria
Yeah Israel isn’t guiltless. But 1) next time don’t conduct ops from hospitals 2) remember the “IDF air strike” that “targeted” that hospital and killed “500+ civilians”
Yeah it does. I’m just glad I’m not an FSU fan
Yeah it doesn’t seem that bad just annoying. As long as it’s not like appendicitis or anything I think I’ll just wait it out
Yeah it is. $40 minimum for a pasta. Although the portions are gigantic 
Yeah it makes me picture Matt Stafford hahaha
Yeah it makes sense. I will dig all that shit up tonight when I get home
Yeah it seems like Washington was exactly in the Colts position before they traded for Wentz lmao
Yeah it sucks when you lose Tony Romo and then trade Tyrod Taylor for Andy Dalton who immediately gets injured
Yeah it was a rough month but I played 5 times in the past 8 days and it came back
Yeah it was also taught by the best teacher my HS had. Super high demand, I was lucky to get enrolled. 
Yeah it was at a non chain theater in SF
Yeah it was bullshit too. I'd just finished beating off like 4 other strong guys, expecting I'd finished the job. But then no, boom, Lance's hyper beams to the face
Yeah it was either that or he's dropped
Yeah it was fucking amazing. Like better than all the GTAs, IMO. And anyway Rockstar just announced a prequel game, so pretty stoked about that 
Yeah it was like the only good series of his career
Yeah it was still good
Yeah it would be an inordinately difficult task to increase scoring without adversely affecting the game in other ways, and any change would piss off millions of fans no matter what it is. And it's all besides the point since no change is coming anytime soon anyway
Yeah it would've been funny if I wasn't getting in trouble lol
Yeah it’s $460+. Smh might just have to suck it up
Yeah it’s a tough bet to quantify. I think the above counts as worth it for me at 2 plus a 1st. 
Yeah it’s good. Not nearly as compelling a topic as Syed but the storytelling is very well done. 
Yeah it’s illegal (idk if the goal is to secede or whatever) but right now the current anti police sentiment allows for this to go on
Yeah It’s learning to be a lib cuck
Yeah it’s like a nascar track but a bit less oval and you walk
Yeah it’s not a subtle movie by any means. And it absolutely has to know what it is received as. Just especially eerie in today’s America
Yeah it’s probably olbermann but I think you’re underselling how much rovell sucks
Yeah it’s really dumb. Was at a work happy hour and somebody brought up Don. And I for some reason went into caricature of an alt right rabid trump supporter and said “Make America great again. Build that Wall. Kick out the Mexicans.” Etc. Somebody outside of my intended audience overheard me.
Yeah it’s retarded (- Chris Broussard)
Yeah it’s where the air operations in the Middle East are run out of
Yeah it's a hidden mass effect relay from Mass Effect 1 duh
Yeah it's a huge deal in FinTech right now
Yeah it's a looooot of men-are-victims mixed in with some women-are-inferior sentiment. So the scorned neckbeards are aplenty
Yeah it's all "our team" which is two people. 
Yeah it's all cards. Most similar to Magic the gathering I've heard, but I never played that. 
Yeah it's almost like the media is trying to create a narrative that a game is going to be super competitive to generate more interest
Yeah it's amazing
Yeah it's fucking boring. It's far worse than the Yankees in the late 90s - mid 2000s.
Yeah it's huge for LoL, DotA, Hearthstone, Starcraft, even Counterstrike. Basically the highly competitive computer games.
Yeah it's in the article and factors into some of their equations. They say come up with a stat called the "goose egg" (basically an inning where an RP  comes in tied or up 1-2 and doesn't allow any runs, one per inning) which has a high correlation to some fancy sabermetric stat
Yeah it's more like playing a team with a bunch of tiny dicks
Yeah it's up and left of the football field
Yeah I've been wanting to go for months and he said this month should have an availability hopefully
Yeah I've heard that too but fuck that noise I'm not gonna shower and NOT wash my hair
Yeah Joe and I were discussing this on Sunday. Legally, they're private entities that can do whatever they want. But we all know they've become so ubiquitous that they're more like public forums. So yeah it's fucked up, but legally they're completely innocent and there is no precedent for anything like this to my knowledge
Yeah Joe pretty much nailed it. Any recruit who would be swayed by a celebrity coach was never considering BC anyway...
Yeah John is gonna outscore the field by 30 so I'm not as upset as if I lost closely
Yeah just like Iran shut down it’s nuke program in 2015
Yeah just multiply that by 1000 and that’s basically BC
Yeah Kevin that was the same message that BC Mike 22 had when he started the whole thing
Yeah Kevin you probably know her 10x better than anyone else. What's her deal? (From what you can gather)
Yeah kinda agree with Becker. Other than gymnastics, swimming, track and sorta wrestling, Olympics don't do it for me
Yeah let's not do that and instead pick a team with zero expectations and therefore can only exceed them. That leaves the Niners, Jets, and Marikas
Yeah like 4 miles from you rn
Yeah like a Raid in WoW Jesus goody it's fucking 2016
Yeah little lockers like at a gym 
Yeah lol I hyped the finance part of the telemarketing job which I really had nothing to do with
Yeah lol I think he and the whole party underestimated how much people hate Hillary
Yeah lots of Qs. Not a lot of As
Yeah makes sense. I've read some stuff about how there's direct correlation between how much a catchers glove moves and the likelihood of it being a strike
Yeah man I can’t help but ask, what was the problem?
Yeah man this is awkward as fuck 
Yeah Marcus put in a 2 leg parlay at even odds when it should have been +2000 
Yeah maybe but check out this video of a guy doing a cool rope swing!
Yeah maybe but it would need to be a long distance friendship though. At least 150 feet at all times, to be specific
Yeah maybe he is freaking out about it but he's doubling down on Tidal according to his Twitter
Yeah maybe I’m just retardsd
Yeah maybe it was more a GM decision. Seahawks were bottom feeders in a very tough NFC west, despite being not that bad. If they were NFC south then I could see that being more likely
Yeah maybe not but at least they made 3 straight conference championships WITHOUT cheating, the last team to do so since the Bills
Yeah maybe. 22 isn’t that bad
Yeah me too, and I think so does most of America. Unfortunately, that holds equally true with Rubio, and the voters rejected him outright
Yeah missed him as one of the guys on the borderline 
Yeah mission is CJTF OIR (the counter Shia Militia and ISIS mission). Job is Joint Targeting.
Yeah my gut says win too. Like the “worth it” ratio of subscribers to pirates must’ve been around 10:1
Yeah ND driving down field, BC gets a big interception and returns it to around the 50. 2 TO left, about 20 seconds. And we just draw up the middle and let the clock run out
Yeah ND, tOSU, Bama have to be top 3
Yeah no
Yeah no brainer you should go full drachman 
Yeah no prob congrats again
Yeah no shit Sherlock. And as BC fans, that fucking sucks. 
Yeah no sorry GPT, you failed on that part
Yeah no way in hell that happens. The question is their use of the underlying technology
Yeah not happy about it but need to
Yeah odds are the Spurs are gonna play their practice squad like they always do the last 8 or so games. But still all it takes is a cold Curry to lose to the Bucks...
Yeah ok can carry a team but barely made the playoffs last year
Yeah or just generally not noticed as much, unlike the Cori Makars and Caila Quinns
Yeah people really hate him. People are saying they hate that he STILL is playing the victim card, that all his troubles are him getting screwed by witch hunts and media framing. 
Yeah pretty impressive y’all got a pic with the entire browns 53 man roster
Yeah pretty much 
Yeah pretty much haha
Yeah pretty much. Every name has a bit of a story. This guy Sparrow named me at a Trail Magic site on a trailhead
Yeah prob like 5-7 per week
Yeah probably
Yeah probably
Yeah probably but still LMAO
Yeah probably. Or someone like chuck hagel
Yeah read that too, but all the piece I read said the impact was more economic? 
Yeah really don't wanna do that, might just quit the league instead
Yeah really makes that Doug Martin scratch hurt even more
Yeah Romo said they gave up 5 YPC over the season
Yeah same the more I think about it. I don’t think I’d prefer tough out the gates in any situation
Yeah same. I got 10/12. Missed Darryl and who was filming the music vid
Yeah SecDef Mattis, SecState Tillerson, and HSS Kelly all said they didnt know what the EO was until it was signed.  Unbelieveable.
Yeah see I think when you have a bunch of what if’s, the simplest explanation is the correct one
Yeah seems kinda re-dardened to me
Yeah seems like that. But whatever it was caused a real “deep breath, calm down brooks, don’t lose it”
Yeah seems low
Yeah seriously Becker with all the crazy off field shit that's happened the past few years, it's stupid to ignore repeated troubling signals
Yeah seriously some of my favorite trips were to China when I was in high school. I loved being a youth in Asia. 
Yeah seriously who called Hanley one? Dude can barely be called a sheep, let alone a 🐐
Yeah she made the Top 5 list for Whitebread
Yeah she sucks
Yeah she was fat in college but then she realized she was a public figure and dropped hella weight
Yeah similar enough tho
Yeah so clearly not superstar names then
Yeah so the alleged top 5 all time claim doesn’t mean much to me. The rift is the story.
Yeah so the jailbreak efforts are in attempt to bypass those types of safeguards, and it’s are obviously understandable why they’re there
Yeah some of the odds were bad
Yeah sooo I don't have a credit card still. Anybody have recommendations?
Yeah sorry Jeff were not all Barstool reading, natty shotgunning, reefer smoking, smokeshow banging bros like yourself
Yeah sorry my cousin came down from NYC spontaneously 
Yeah stroud is too low. One above or below Purdy  
Yeah such a FLB that Marcus offers EVEN fuck out of here
Yeah Tetherow Hole 7. He called me screaming hahaha
Yeah that definitely hurt but the general consensus is no, since he rebounded quite well after getting crushed in NH (which was the day after the Christie moment)
Yeah that description matches perfectly 
Yeah that is all true, except Chloe smoked and you passed
Yeah that Jameis-esque lol but it worked out
Yeah that makes a lot more sense to me than a Long con by kraft 
Yeah that seems like a super easy way to cheat salary caps
Yeah that seems really back asswards
Yeah that seems smart. All depends on their balance sheet. They got 2 years to get some income projections
Yeah that statement is soft as hell. 
Yeah that was 2 days ago
Yeah that was also wild but the bad guys won so I try to suppress that one
Yeah that was like 2 hours ago
Yeah that was lucky. There was a PI earlier on the drive tho that was BS
Yeah that works, though I thought there were separate discussions about removing the SAT punishment 
Yeah that’s a war crime. As is beheading children, cutting fetuses out from pregnant women, setting families on fire, executing hostages, and live steaming it all on the victims social media accounts.
Yeah that’s about what I thought 
Yeah that’s all I drink from but I filter it
Yeah that’s does seem crazy to me
Yeah that’s fine and all it was more the mass shooting threats and stuff
Yeah that’s my point too lol. But if you have Russ, DK and Lockett, your offense was humming first half last year before Lockett got hurt, and your OL sucks. Then you sack your OC for passing too much and you want to run the ball behind that already bad OL, and your defense sucked. Point being the Pete Carroll side should get a lot of shit too.  
Yeah that’s possible but it’s more that all the things the haters said about him preseason have basically been proven accurate. That plus the broncos shopping him in the off-season. Not great vibes.
Yeah that’s pretty much it
Yeah that’s retarded
Yeah that’s right bitch crawl back into your cave
Yeah that’s super duper gay
Yeah that’s the bigger news than the result. Trump won the district by 20 points
Yeah that’s the right girl. She had that hot nerd thing going on
Yeah that’s too hot for me
Yeah that’s true. I fully thought denver was gonna kick ass this year
Yeah that’s what they said about Chase lol
Yeah that’s what worries me. Last time SF paid whatever it took to affect a judges decision, Roe still got overturned
Yeah that’s where I’d choose too, though Hoboken/JC isn’t terrible and you get better taxes. 
Yeah that’s why “essential worker” is largely BS IMO
Yeah that’s why I agree with John on that point. But by junior year it’s over and we tend to forget 
Yeah that’s why it makes sense but college sports are inherently different 
Yeah that’s why the yards and TD stats don’t matter that much to me
Yeah that's basically it though haha. Yours might actually be more correct with counting the previous attempts...
Yeah that's basically what I'm saying. We have it so fucking good here in the US. I hate that we might undermine the whole thing because it's not good enough. 
Yeah that's because we bought our soil from Central Africa to give funds to the potential future first round draft picks who live there. Niners truly are global philanthropists. 
Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying I don't like. If you do something awesome, you should be rewarded with a goal. Instead it's meaningless 95% of the time
Yeah that's like already the extent of my thinking lol
Yeah that's my Goldman boss
Yeah that's pretty much accurate 
Yeah that's really fucked up but statute of limitations applies here
Yeah that's the famous number. Also realized this is actually just stats on college degrees not actual jobs. 
Yeah that's the second softest rule in the game. #1 is lane violations
Yeah that's the tldr haha
Yeah the awesome loot requires higher levels, but it's not necessarily "easier"
Yeah the biggest teams from different leagues were gonna jump ship to a “super league” 
Yeah the bus that I have to RIDE
Yeah the CNN report without all the details is damning enough, but most of the fanfare has shifted to the details in the Buzzfeed report
Yeah the energy just feels really low for something so hyped up
Yeah the Greyjoys have been absent but it looks like they're about to cover that in this season. Martells were just completely replaced
Yeah the market crashed past few days. Better today tho
Yeah the minor characters in the books are wayyyy better. Major ones are more are less comparable IMO
Yeah the more I thought about it the more they should be a lock
Yeah the narrative all pre draft was he’s probably bad (and has tiny hands), but the least bad
Yeah the new audio seemed to corroborate his side of the story
Yeah the record for bad puns made per mile
Yeah the Senator from California. Think we talked about her a couple months ago
Yeah the songs flow together good but the songs suck
Yeah the success of the musical is the main reason they're putting a woman on the $20 instead of the $10 as planned
Yeah the Thompson’s are a lock to finish 2-4
Yeah there is still a lot in book 3/4 that is still untouched by the show
Yeah there were definitely kids in my middle school that would push this to the absolute limit. And I bet there are at every school
Yeah there's a plausible theory that the balls were juiced before prior to last season
Yeah there's a serious dearth of good RBs that is probably gonna last all year, so it makes sense that people are trying to get any potential solutions as early as possible
Yeah there's no official time for it, but we should know by 11:30
Yeah they do but I meant more for fatigue for the Warriors next opponent
Yeah they offer that this probably wasn’t a rash decision by the PGA and they had considered all their options, and that the PGA decided this was their best option, even knowing how unpopular it would be amongst their top players and fans  
Yeah they said it was the biggest margin in Final Four history, and second highest FG% in final four history 
Yeah they were really good and I’d love to hear some Becker takes on that whole fiasco. The Bruce Lee and 1998 HR race ones weren’t nearly as good
Yeah they’re really getting the full titanic experience
Yeah They're great from what I understand, and they're able to function the way they do because they are small population, ethically homogenous countries who don't have or want international power
Yeah they're not scrubs but like its the Cavs. And I expect the Cavs to win 4-3
Yeah they're pretty obscure. Only Myr I def would've got (Thoros of Myr)  
Yeah thinking about it I'd buy my celebrity. I'd basically try to be Mark Cuban
Yeah this article is pretty shoddy. They use EPA (expected points added) as their metric and that's it, plus what goody said about Brady (though they do have a few sentences about his omission affecting the data). 
Yeah this early on each data point is swingy 
Yeah this is going great
Yeah this is their great grandfather 
Yeah this sucks 
Yeah this was extremely incorrect in hindsight, unlike my wirfs takes
Yeah this was hysterical 
Yeah this was the worst. As someone who hated presentation and cared about data, I fucking hated this part of the job
Yeah ticket sales and concessions. Plus I guess Jumbotron ads and stuff.
Yeah Tim Duncan's idea of a dirty play is stepping into the key before the free throw hits the rim.
Yeah too bad they don't actually do shit. Remember they declared war on ISIS in January?
Yeah too bad, no offer for you
Yeah true but I would still take the omelette station again
Yeah ultimately it was just not fun anymore and was more of a headache than enjoyable.
Yeah unfortunately I agree
Yeah unless you expect him to raisi from the dead
Yeah wasn’t my initial intention but that’s the way the cookie crumbles I guess 
Yeah we were discussing how many hard hits to the head we’ve taken in our lives, all of us were under 10. He is probably over 1000
Yeah we’re about to see conference championships be meaningless
Yeah we’re flying and starting together. He finishes his job June 1
Yeah we’re good. Waiting for the cops now. Dude fled the scene
Yeah we'll explain how it stayed quiet for 1.5 years at BC!!
Yeah well I lost
Yeah we'll see... I might not have a choice
Yeah well you're projected to get your ass dropped by Champion Chan in the boxing match of the century, so how you like them projections now?!
Yeah who the fuck was she anyway? Did she go to BC?
Yeah whoever did that should get the death penalty
Yeah with uncensored secret documents!
Yeah wow this is quite detailed and certainly believable
Yeah wtf kinda click bait ass message was that 
Yeah wtf? How would zone be illegal that's so dumb.
Yeah you do...
Yeah you really need to redefine your approach 
Yeah you tell ‘em 
Yeah you tell ‘em. Bad look for all the FH who’ve been defending Liberty for the past week
Yeah you’d have to punch or grasp it mid dive bomb
Yeah you’re not a real Yankees fan 
Yeah you’re the only guy blasting 10000 DB music 
Yeah you're right I exaggerated. Still sad
Yeah Zink. She stormed off screaming and I cried laughing
Yeah, and they mention that a few times. Tldr: use them in 1-2 run leads, use them for 2 innings, and in ties (i.e. the highest leverage situations). Worrying about the save statistic is meaningless for actually having the team win.  
Yeah, but probably not enough. Nathaniel Rakich said Trump needs to win 63% of the remaining vote, and the latest batch had him winning 59%. Gonna be close
Yeah, but that's basically the whole point. If you want experience and a whole team of different levels (and can pay out the ass for it), hire Accenture. If you want 2 BAs for cheap, hire this firm. 
Yeah, especially when instructions are conflicted. Like you get yelled at to do something one way, you do it, then get yelled at by someone else to do it another way. And some people have said “sir, I was told to do it X way”, when it’s better to just say “I’m sorry sir” and move on. 
Yeah, if you're a woman you're basically livestock. Can't leave the house without a male companion, for example 
yeah, or they fall in line, republicans especially
Yeah. Considering how Dany's two successful conquests of cities have resulted in one being burned to the ground with all its people dying of illness, and the other is in active civil war, what gives her confidence that she can lead a tribe of 10000 Dothraki to peace considering their culture is based on raiding, looting, murder, and rape?
Yeah. I feel like you're saying they watch the horrors around them and marvel with entertainment...
Yeah. I know you said so and goody said he'll be out for a wedding too. If everybody is busy then I'll just do it in NY but i was hoping it would be sort of funny 
Yeah. It’s May. OTAs have started, which means fantasy season has started too
Yeah. That’s the safest option
Yeah. The key people who could've screwed me (my boss at the time and my career counselor) both have my back, so I got away scot free
Yeah. They're a Kurdish rebel group who's the closest thing the US has to an ally. But they're also Turkey's main enemy. And they're allied with the PKK which is basically an anti Turkish terror group. 
Yeah. We got left on read. 
Yeah... chan are you serious?
Yeah... definitely...
Yeahhh I can see myself being accusatory about a trade like that... I'm still pro-deadline but whatever
Year 2000!
Year but you believe in >2 genders so it's the same thing

Yep it’s all I wear now every day 
Yep it's hilarious. I hope the WNBA does too. 
Yep it's Reddit bullshit
Yep only 6 states allow you to remain anonymous 
Yep that is correct. It's astounding
Yep we’re at the point where it’s a lot of on-the-fence skeptics left and the CDC did NOT help convince them 
Yep, a 2018 NYG over 6.5 wins (❌) guy 
Yep, we also shook hands afterward and said everything is settled, then watched the super bowl next to each other, then you started talking shit hours later on groupme
Yep. “So that guy just showed up and hung around and he’s not even part of your group?”
Yep. Played here Wed Fri today and tm
Yep. Shoulda worked too
Yep. Thought weirdly a lot about it actually. Decided on 9

Yes @Skimmer, and it also means you're anti obama
Yes 2-5
Yes a lot about it
Yes absolutely but the volume, speed, and varied angles of attacks was Blitzkrieg-esque (a tactic of whom the originators I strongly denounce)
Yes absolutely. In December over the phone, but it's not like I recorded those calls
Yes absolutely. It was like a music festival, except lots of fancy clothing. Seemed like 75% of people were <30. And the college fraternities and sororities were out in full force. 
Yes all good and exciting players, but most of them are on losing teams because they're not dominant enough to lead winning teams in today's league.
Yes and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise 
Yes and it was 2 girls schools  
Yes and maybe?
Yes and no. Because it’s clearly proven that discerning who will or will not be a good QB is extremely difficult
Yes and the city of Seattle
Yes and they cleared out half the tables to make a dance floor
Yes and they're a well coached team
Yes and you'll notice I ignored all of goodys counterpoints, the true Fuckholes way
Yes Anesto throws bangerz there with Chris Brown and Trey Songz
"Yes around 6/10 weekend @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 

Man cave with the carpet as a baseball diamond and walls painted as AT&T park with the TV nesting perfectly where the Jumbotron is "
Yes audio cut out for me. I'm watching on Amazon prime so I'm 30'seconds behind or so
Yes because I definitely own myself in fantasy
Yes because I flew from Baghdad to Kuwait at 5 am 
Yes because the money is going from the purchasers to the govt and the winner
Yes Becker
Yes Becker it makes sense, I just didn't think it would be as weighted as those statistics show
Yes Becker they are now
Yes Becker true detective S1 and the Wire are also on this list
Yes Bernie is a frontrunner. Trump is almost surely going to be the republican nominee because an incumbent challenger has never ever succeeded
Yes but after curls on the squat rack
Yes but athletically
Yes but he didn't say anything again until just now
Yes but hotter 
"Yes but I cheated. Back when one of y’all posted your results and I knew you used Adieu as first word. 

It still disgusts me when my stats come up after every game"
Yes but i he got hurt on that play so it’s a little understandable 
Yes but I meant from a tactical perspective. They key thing is that the Russians look poised to takeover everything east of the Siversky Donets river. But I don’t think it majorly affects the strategic picture.
Yes but id expect him to say something more like “we had an amazing season and I wanna run it back”
Yes but it’s also true
Yes but nobody really used that
Yes but not recently 
Yes but now he coaches Columbus, and Team USA Hockey
Yes but that’s not what we called him lol
Yes but their underpreparedness is part of what has made the discourse so fucking funny
Yes but they’re under the department of the navy 
Yes but tough to see individual player numbers
Yes but you have to be a certified patient first. Minimum 6 years of schooling before you can see a doctor
Yes CCP and Ayatollah Khamenei (not Thompson). Lots of jihadis but not like official accounts lol
Yes chargers this week
Yes Clemson my b
Yes corruption, a big point in favor of trump lmao
Yes CVS or Walgreens or whatever should have them
Yes dammit
Yes definitely
Yes goodwin 
Yes Goody
Yes goody I am apart from you and about to be aparter 
Yes goody, 4 hits 8 Ks. But I lied it was actually game 5
Yes goody. Player values, payouts, Eric. are more or less equal and there are millions of entries on each site, so assuming the clientele is no different, on average the two websites are essentially the same. The worst part is that this may not be illegal since it's such a new industry
Yes haha. During RTB
Yes hahaha beats all the Trump Hillary sketches by far
Yes he is
Yes he texted me and said he didn’t believe my golf scores 
Yes he was
"Yes he was a baddie. No it’s not trading one for another, and it’s not necessarily less stability. 

Assad largely answered to Iran, and launched fires at Israel repeatedly. Assadist Syria also enabled Iranian control of Hezbollah and Hamas, which obviously created the war in the past 13 months. "
Yes he's white Daquan, and he's made a career from posting on IG... got TV deals, plus size modeling, advertising, etc. He got a ton of flak from comedians who claimed and basically proved he stole their jokes and often purposely edited out their watermarks to prevent that exact situation. Females love him because he posts funny things on IG, and bitches love IG. 
Yes highest ever
Yes I believe it
Yes I believe the claim was made by darrowball about 30 mins ago
Yes I could do San Mateo
Yes I document my success, don't hate 
Yes I have
Yes I have $1 left over
Yes I have famously been silent about trump for the past 2 years lol
Yes I know
Yes I know a few, and "know" a lot on Facebook 
Yes I know. But does Gronk like Bill
Yes I know. Everybody do it. 
Yes I love conflict!!
Yes I think they matter a lot
YES I was just talking about that yesterday
Yes I would 100%
Yes I wrote on the bombs. No I didn’t write any ethnic slurs 
Yes I’m aware he can squat like 600 pounds. That’s why we need 2 guys on the legs/hips
Yes I’m aware he’s like 26
Yes I’m excited but I’m sad I may miss several weddings 
Yes I’ve am watching 
Yes I’ve seen it mentioned here dozens of times 
Yes if you expect BJs
Yes in 3 boxes total
Yes in the hallways but not in the rooms, and service in the hallways is spotty at best
Yes it could. I am of the opinion that you should plan ahead.
Yes it do
Yes it does are you nuts?
Yes it gives more evidence that trump has some kind of connection with Russia he doesn't want exposed. This is now the second advisor fired for ties with Russia (Paul manafort was the first). My guess is trump will try pin it all on Flynn and say "okay he's out we're all clean now". But also there's the possibility Flynn has nothing to lose and starts spilling the beans on trump
Yes it is
Yes it is
Yes it is 
Yes it screws responsible students and those who chose to go to cheaper colleges. But realistically, the whole student debt forgiveness policy has a lot of popularity and momentum. I think something is gonna happen sooner than later. 
Yes it would have been
Yes it’s a back down kind of thing mainly. Kavanaugh says he’s innocent, puts a bad look to pull him, especially when your base is vocally anti #metoo. I agree it’s the right strategic decision to pull him and nominate Barrett. What drachman said is true about the possibility (however unlikely) about losing the seat permanently, and that’s enough of a worst case for them to go for the sure thing IMO
Yes it’s also tax free
Yes it’s an insult to meritocracy
Yes it’s basic training for officers. Supposed to be harder and a lot more class
Yes it’s interesting 
Yes it’s one of the major “fundamentals” but a lot of those fundamentals (incumbency, endorsements, etc) seem to have dropped off precipitously in their predictive power in the past 8 years
Yes it’s sanders 
Yes it’s swollen, no drainage, only one side, no fevers
Yes it’s true. Says “rate limit exceeded”
Yes it's black wizard of oz. was an old Broadway soul musical that was really popular, then got made into a movie with Aretha Franklin and Michael Jackson. 
Yes it's early and of course this is just a model. But you have lots of historical and polling data. 
Yes it's Molly MgGrath
Yes it's recency bias but I think in this situation it's fair
YES IVE BEEN NERVOUS ALL DAY 
Yes Jeff
Yes Jeff getting there
Yes Jeff. That’s the joke. 
Yes John, that's the major risk
YES John. That guy!!
Yes Jon Bois
Yes just a specific few people
Yes just like the AFC south was last year 
Yes just online. All free (so far), mostly just on YouTube 
Yes lmao that’s why I commented “deja vu” above
Yes lmfao those were kinda fun tho
Yes lol
Yes lol
Yes marcus I do. It drives me nuts but I can’t deny it
Yes market difference (I assume), and yes only 2 hours apart. Major major cultural difference. 
Yes mine did
Yes no more confusing darrow and Becks
Yes one of my 67 teams
Yes please
Yes probably but that’s very trivial
Yes real life hot. Meh TV hot
Yes really bad since like beginning of 2020. I feel like I get at least one a day
Yes released before he dies
Yes standard points
Yes T8 inclusive
Yes team, 4v4, match play. I think the handicap just dictates your opponent 
Yes that includes Taylor and other Kevin
Yes that what my company does haha
Yes that’s Florida
Yes that’s the joke
Yes that’s what made me think of it
Yes that’s why the rook bait was so sexy 
Yes that's a problem. It's also less of a problem than it has ever been in the history of the world, and hunger is much less of a problem in capitalist societies than in socialist ones
Yes that's what I'm saying. 
Yes that's why he wasn't running as an independent. He theoretically could run as a republican and go through the RNC, but that's 100x less likely than Rubio being nominated hahaha
Yes the guy "knew the risk". But the risk that CNN (or say Microsoft in groupme's case) wanted to come out and go out of their way to fuck you over is bullshit, especially when all they want is petty revenge. Same goes for all smear attempts over petty revenge
Yes the RNC strong armed the rules through and never allowed a roll call vote, simple as that 
Yes the turnover is unprecedented 
Yes the wedding was extravagant
Yes there are Jewish terrorists. There are some anti Palestinian cells in Israel 
Yes they are. 237 total Jesus 
Yes they still make them. Definitely up there
Yes this graph is assuming "at current pace of 1.75 million shots per day".  Would hope/expect that rate increases.
Yes this is the debate I was hoping for
Yes to New York
Yes trivia. No to goody. Technically yes to Jeff 
Yes US only. From Josh Zumbrun of WSJ
Yes watching
Yes we watched spirited away. I wrote a paper on it for Chinese religion and philosophy class
Yes weeks 5-17. You’re up 5-0 so far
Yes wow great memory. And it wasn’t a kid it was like a 60 year old white guy with long gray hair.
Yes yes, you're weakening the argument
Yes you can buy whatever you want. Your housing allowance is essentially part of your salary unless you live on base, at which point they take your housing allowance 
Yes, #6
Yes, “[list of 20 players/teams] are bad”
Yes, and if you’re cool with those countries’ ability to determine their own path or suffer from Russian invasion that will kill a lot of people and also cause a gigantic refugee crisis
Yes, and it's like the 1/10000000 times that I actually agree with Obama
Yes, and they were supposed to be on the same side. The US's #1 ally now is Kurdistan, but we can't support them fully against Iraq because they are basically our #2 ally, and the people we've been supporting for a decade. 
Yes, as in -5 at best
Yes, as lampooned by Eric Cartman
yes, because of gang movies and stuff
Yes, but I don’t think Joe Bourque’s methods involve a dartboard
yes, but they renamed it to RAPTOR for some reason
Yes, but when you tweet things like this, it's now direct hypocrisy 
Yes, especially on the squat 
Yes, financed by muni bonds
Yes, from the development of the A bomb and ending with the Cuban missile crisis 
Yes, her and Biden
Yes, high octane 
yes, i still believe what i said before: that the Gaza targets are assessed valid targetable by the IDF, and that true civilian casualties are a lot more likely to be the product of hamas rocket misfires than IAF strikes
Yes, if this was any serious proposal, but for now it's just an idea I had in the shower
Yes, it felt weird to do 
Yes, it's called using the waiver wire
Yes, Marcus has contested. Kasich comp is probably Klob
Yes, obviously hindsight is 20/20
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
Yes, that's exactly what it means
Yes, the standard is how good of a baseball player you are, and if you did things that actually hurt people instead of just their pussy feelings
Yes, they (alongside IAMD) attempt to intercept things
Yes, they're all too good haha
Yes, to a degree. Charles Barkley made a bunch of claims that he would be terrible because he was just tall. He ended up being good, mostly because of his size (which is true for most 7 foot plus players), but also because of his talent. There are lots of other players who were close to his size who sucked
Yes, we need to solidify a date lol
Yes, Zanzibar is the answer
Yes. "Council of CoC"
Yes. Aka COLLUSION
Yes. And gloves are different. That's it
Yes. And hopefully US Intel is way ahead of that should they ever get close to considering that option
Yes. And you have avoided me for years on end
Yes. But a hearthstone (basically magic the gathering) tournament. A player is from HK, in a post match interview stated his support for HK democracy. Under pressure from China, blizzard banned him from the tourney and fired the commenters who interviewed him.  
Yes. But it was you being an ass about important issues 
Yes. Followed closely by WRs
Yes. Fortunately early slate Sunday football is 8 pm so I should be able to catch that, depending on my schedule 
Yes. Games have been sold out all season. Cannot speak to TV ratings
Yes. Got a $7MM tax cut to keep 800 jobs in Indiana. Still is moving 1300 to Mexico. 
Yes. I can’t understand the people in Ennis
Yes. I needed the record padding
Yes. I remember that very clearly. My honors class had a whole discussion on it, of which one of the loudest voices was our man Maz
Yes. I think groupme changed their linking to go right to the app and it’s causing problems because apparently Microsoft developers are trash
Yes. I’ll do assignments tonight 
Yes. I’m doubling down and betting with my heart 
Yes. Italy is top 5 as well
Yes. I've seen her twice since graduation, for the super bowl last year, and when we all went to black rose. I sat next to her at a table at black rose. Never been less happy to sit next to an attractive girl in my life
Yes. Just watched it. It's crazy
Yes. Likely that they're fwds from Hillary to Huma using Weiners email. 
Yes. Long trip back starts at 6
Yes. No. 
Yes. Of course the colts would want that. Predicting the bidding market confidently is not a strategy I’d bank on if I was the colts.
Yes. Old Smarmy Jew Rat David Stern
"Yes. Order of events was:
Trump airs video, praising himself for travel ban in January and response in March
Reporter says what about February 
Trump goes bananas"
Yes. Poorly, to say the least...
Yes. Receiver fair catches and is run into by his own teammate, ball hits his foot as they're falling 
Yes. Southern district of New York 
Yes. The rollout continues to be unbelievably shoddy, hopefully significantly better after a full month has already passed
Yes. The UK will not be a part of the EU after tomorrow 
Yes. They’re usually idiot cowboys fans.
Yes. This is me launching him into the air holding the back left chair leg (top 4 most important chair legs) 
Yes. Twice that I can remember. Both risked farts that went south 
Yes. We could also do: $50 on season match ups, reg season record, and playoff performance. So 3x$50
Yes. Whittle down the bat that you stuck out with into a sharp edge 
Yes. You gotta take all the risks if youre PIT

Yesterday against the spurs he scored 14 straight with ~3 minutes left and led the comeback victory 
Yesterday an MD sent out an email to the whole Financial Services group congratulating a team on a big sale. But they forgot to edit the generic email, so it said "Congrats on the Sale with Financial Services Company", proceeded by like 8 paragraphs of complete bullshit. I found it hysterical. 
Yesterday Chan typo asked “gas the groupme been lit enough for you” and I replied “yes high octane” and nobody got the pun, but I am recovering
Yesterday I did a 5 miler to get to this hostel at 9 am and watched CFB all day, then today I slack packed 12 Miles by 1 pm to watch NFL all day. It’s been a great weekend for Dingers
Yesterday I had the worst moment of the game. Just sat down for dinner and go on poke vision and there's a squirtle on my block. I have to catch it right? So I get up, go outside (middle of NYC mind you) walk over and see that squirtle. Razz, great ball... Poof, Squirtle ran away! Clench my fist like Arthur after DW broke his plane and walked back to my apartment and got high
yesterday i mightve convinced a vaccine skeptic to be 1% more likely to get the vaccine. he said he "refuses to be a lab rat" and instead of trying to convince him the vaccine is actually safe, i said "yeah maybe but i just want to get back to normal, and im willing to take the risk in order to do that."  he made a face like "hmm thats not a bad point"
Yesterday I posted a 538 article on ways trump is undermining the election process and nobody read it
Yesterday I read the best argument against amateur/NCAA players making money off their own likeness. Basically changed my mind to be against it and curious to know what you guys think
Yesterday I was walking and some enlisted marines class got out of a building and started walking in details toward me, I had to salute like 200 marines in 100 feet. I’ve actually started avoiding groups.
Yesterday this black woman was doing curls by lying on a bench that she put in the pull up / cables section in the middle of that giant pulley machine. In doing so, she was able to take up a bench plus space for 2-3 different people to excersize. I was almost impressed at the inconsiderateness 
Yesterday was a blast in groupme so thank you all for being very entertaining 
Yesterday we were trying to name the top 5 hottest women on base (BONK) and we got to 3 
Yesterdays game was a lose lose for molested victims

Y'know Marcus if you write up a power rankings this week, there's a 100% chance we're gonna get a power rankings this week
Y'know what would be funny. If this year, two posa participants both had to take the SAT, then the lower score has to take it next year too against next years posa loser. Lower score has to take it again next year and so on
Yo but the stories about Tyreeks situation are really fucked up
Yo did y'all see the top post on r/NBA today?

You also said you get 3 votes so you can understand the confusion...

You are correct. The partner was not amused. 
You are either very dedicated or a masochist or both
You are figuratively eating it. Let's say you're doing your best mia khalifa impression

You asked for spice, and I’m giving the people what they want!
You asked. He answered. 
You basically just have to prove that you're trying. If you're unstaffed for a while (like a month), flags will start being raised and you'll get grilled/fired if you haven't been trying to get on a project 
You beat a Chechnyan in wrestling. That’s more impressive than beating the Boston bomber
You bet $20, I pay $10

You can quit goodwin. All it takes is a failed drug test that threatens your job
You can say Red if the 2 hats in front are the same, blue if they're different
You can say that but the numbers never lie. He's been less than solid this year despite his amazingly easy schedule. You also already have other RBs you can start.
You can see where this is going though. Is there a point at which the majority should stop subsidizing the minority as the minority gets smaller and their costs rise, be it 95-5, 99-1, etc etc. And ability to provide is another question: how much should you charge people to pay for others
You can set it on ESPN and/or message me somehow, up to you
You can smell em when you're walking down the steet

You can watch WRs run routes
You can write off your loans if your income is low enough, which is infuriatingly ironic 
You can, and people do. But usually they stop caring because everyone else has stopped caring too
You can’t lol it only shows playlist recipients
You can’t pass on that opportunity! Russ certainly wouldn’t pass 
You cannot compare the US to Scandinavia because the US is way bigger, more demographically diverse, and poorer
YOU CANT BE THE BEST FOR 15 YEARS AND BE ADORED AT THE SAME TIME!! PICK ONE DAMMIT!
You can't just sweep us under the rug. A lot happened, as much as you'd like to pretend it didn't
You can't pick anything for which the result is already known, because that's basically screwing somebody with a retroactively applied rule
You can't win with <50%. It becomes a brokered convention 
You can't you quit that league

You could legit pull out your hair in chunks it was gross
You could legit say that because of the initial no’s, you decided to make it a guys thing
You could probably hop on the campaign for one of the Democrats and hope to parlay that into a job
You could probably land a job as a pitching coach at a very high level, maybe even the bigs 
You could start corporation in South Africa to help the poor, pay employees really well to get good people, and truly try help the world 
You could t tell by the 500 people watching you?

You have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.
You have to pay somebody for their index fund, vanguard or otherwise. The vanguard 500 is as cheap as any index fund is going to get, the fees are negligible

There’s never been a better use of the quote"
You have to say. Is it Nick or emyr?

You heard the man. Stay far away from Emyr
You idiot
You idiot 
You jamoke
You just don’t want to be out celebritied in here
You just don't know it yet
You just get your W2 and follow the instructions and that's it. I know I have no deductions or anything, so it's no use for me to use a service
You just have to hope preventative care works! And that requires a faith in people, of which I have very little! 
You just need a designated guy
You just saved me hours of time
You kidding me? Yanks hauled in the fucking mother lode for those guys. They have NINE top prospects right now, surely some will be flipped for superstars but others could be the next Jeter.
You knew they were gonna go for it when they ran on 3rd
You know @Hongy T this is like the perfect time for the 6-12-18-24 challenge 
You know becker you're in half marathon shape, this may be your best ever time to hold the Beatdown in Beantown since you'll have a major cardio advantage
You know how in Harry Potter there is a physical change in the room when a dementor enters? That’s Bill. 
You know how significant of an advantage that is
You know how they say to lift with your legs? Well I just did that putting down a heavy ass box and ripped my  jeans right at the asshole so having a great day over here
You know how when you’re a kid shooting hoops and you do the buzzer beating shot, but if you miss somehow there’s still 3 seconds and then if you make the next one, it counts? That’s what just happened to the broncos 
You know I had to do it to em, alhamdulillah*
You know I love Cormier but picking him against one of th best heavyweights of all time isn’t a good use bet
You know I was gonna include you but then I deleted it, but I guess my gut was right 
You know if we win all of our 60% probability win games, that’s like incredibly impressive
You know it was a good episode because Daenerys didn't make a single appearance 
You know it would be pretty cool if Covid inspired a bunch of Gen Z to go into the scientific fields
You know it's actually a charity to fund Jewish culture? 
You know it's funny. I could've sat syndergard and locked up walks, but I chose not to and figured I'd let it rip
You know the is a hot dog a sandwich debate, and how people justify a yes with all these stupid technicalities.  Sometimes you just need some damn common sense to be like "no, i know what a sandwich is and thats not a sandwich"
You know the place
You know this would be a great time for more states to legalize marijuana. Literally no better incentive to stay home and watch Netflix 
"You know what did outpace the S&P 500? 

Team Kelleher’s Best Ball (aka “these ridiculous things” portfolio."
You know what else would make the groupme smile that involves Becker and boxing?
you know what I mean
You know what I’m in on that take
You know what might be worth a shot? You take the command to not bill the hours, but in return you ask for a written email recommendation from this person to your boss (or whoever could promote you). 
You know what they say. Buy le dip 
"You know what they say:

If someone owes you $100, they have a problem.
If someone owes you $1000000, you have a problem. "
You know what you can handle it. You have an open bench spot now
You know which one you're missing
You know who else is at the top of the power rankings? New Mexico motherfucker! Choo Choo here comes the Santa Fe express bitches

You liked the message lmao
You literally just rendered your previous statement invalid hahaha
You live next to Rob Goger
You look spiffy out there?
You made me want to look it up 
You may be right. My biased viewpoint is that the deflections are more because of the media and not his prowess. But I refuse to admit trump is good at anything. 
You may not like it, but that’s what peak male performance looks like
You mean body count?
You mean if they turned the graph upside down?
You mean Ladder golf 
You mean like back in nineteen ninety eight when Undertaker threw Mankind off hell in a cell and plunged 16 feet through the announcers table?
You mean Little Caesar’s “Hot and Ready”
You mean Marcus?
You mean people would divest from crypto if the stock market tumbles?

You might be eligible for Medicaid, even as a student
You might be the only person on the planet who’s done the 6 12 18 24 challenge TWICE 
you might not like it, but that's what peak happiness housing looks like
You might not like it, but this is what peak male performance looks like
You missed a wild time becker
You must be fun at parties
You must have been elated
You must have some dank cranberry sauce
You must’ve been going ham panda during the BC Nelly concert

You need hard fast rules because people abuse elastic clauses
You need to be more pacific. What is “anything significant”

You own a store. You sell apples for $1. All of a sudden hundreds of people rush in and say give me apples. You're gonna raise the price on apples

You play LT for the chiefs
You poors cant hang with me and my new $36000 2020 Subaru Outback
You pretty much covered it. They were the archetype of a wealthy, moderate, and democratic Muslim nation for decades, and a major NATO ally. The last 10-15 years has seen a drastic shift toward ultra conservative Islamism in the common public, as well as by President Erdogan.
You pretty much have to finish all 6 jerks before you get more than 12 beers deep
You prob haven’t updated your address just like secret Santa 
You prob won't have a choice to not upgrade though, since apple always finds a way to force you to upgrade
You reference that like it’s truth, then simultaneously refuse to accept my bet on Biden at better odds

You should create a glassdoor API that pulls that estimate into Facebook / Linked In / etc

You should say "Think it's sunny here? You should see Philadelphia!"
You should start saying Menino-esque things like "oh yeah once Iginla connected on that out route all we had to do was clear the ball and we were good"
You should try your absolute best. Brings back the whole topic about surveillance and terrorism, and I was saying you have to draw the line somewhere and draw it clearly, so the law won't be abused. 
You should wear a “very legal and very cool” t shirt 
You should’ve heard my Chris Godwin pun on Sunday 
You should’ve withdrawn your Goff take instead
You smart
You start Chan
You still have access??
You still suck, just... less so
You suck darrow
You sure they weren’t talking about a big box retailer akin to Sam’s Club?
You tell ‘em Gonzaga guy
You tell them Emyr. Tell them theyre broker than the intended audience of many modern rap songs 
You telling me Reddit is full of weirdos? 
You think at any point they asked each other “do you think any part of this sounds too self important?”
You think couples in Harry Potter ever take polyjuice potion of each other and then bang?
You think he could've/should've got more?
You think he got a Baracko Choco Cake for dessert?
You think his people waited for him to have a great shot, then told him? I can’t imagine they told him right after a shank lmfao.

You took the LSAT. Try figure it out based on the provided information
You traded a guaranteed top 10 RB for ALEX SMITH?!

You win Marcus I'm not doing it again
You win!
You won the championship because some scrubs didn't bid on Deangelo Williams
You won’t!

You would be right 
You would get along with our Chief
You would go to hell if you gleefully took your win on a cancelled game 
you would like being surrounded by seamen
You would’ve loooved it
You wouldn't be alone in predicting it, that's for sure. I certainly don't think the current model is sustainable, but my question is does it pop ala housing, or is it fixed somehow? And the timing is always key
You wouldn't be Anthony goodwin if you did it any other way
YOU 👏🏼 ARE 👏🏼 NOT 👏🏼 IN 👏🏼 THIS 👏🏼 LEAGUE
You, regarding Sweden and the Rona @#JustFacts✅ 
You’d also look hot in a captains uniform
You’d basically be playing red rover but need to keep the puck. And it’s 12 on 1, we’d literally just need to clear the puck and you’d never be able to get possession
You’d never not 2 putt and you’d up and down a ton
You’d probably get a FAFSA bump and some other grants. But if you’ve researched it then you’d know better
You’d think after their rookie RB got shot by 2 teenagers in a very popular area they would think about it, but nah it’s racist or something
You’d think somebody in that position would be wheeling and dealing with some trades 🤔 
You’d think the man accusing another of not understanding sarcasm would understand sarcasm
You’d think they’d have ironed that out before hand but no of course not
You’d think this administration would avoid talking about little kids genitals for a bit
You’ll be beating becker in no time 
YOU’ll let ME buy out?! Bitch id ask for whatever your on but I’d prob get dishonorable discharges
You’ll probably meet a ton of Bellarmine folks
You’ll want a car
You’re 1/1, time to say “at this point I could throw a dart anywhere and it’ll be a bullseye”
You’re a bad sports fan
You’re a devout democrat. Tell me how I should feel
You’re a grown man. Eat the pudding skin like the crust of pizza
You’re an Italian from north shore Massachusetts. You are catholic to the core whether you like it or not
You’re essentially betting that over the past ~75 years, humanity has evolved to a new level of maturity and consciousness that will alter the driving force of history for all time.
You’re forgetting the F-35 flyover and the genesis halftime show
You’re getting Mac Jones. The earlier you accept it the easier it will be 
You’re going to grad school??
You’re gonna give Joe an aneurism 
You’re gonna have the cleanest butthole ever
You’re immediately one of the 5 hardest throwers in the history of baseball, and that’s being conservative 
You’re insane if you think Paul George is better than Kyrie, or that Kyrie is your problem
You’re just jealous the Pats never had a coach as genius or successful as Shanahan
You’re just mad you didn’t get it
You’re literally betting on something under your control
You’re making this less fun
You’re never eating corn again
You’re not and he didn’t
You’re not rooting for DJ or Cam Smith?
You’re not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need
You’re not wrong but he’s almost equally as good at the PGA
You’re not wrong but tough to outratio a denominator of zero
You’re not wrong. But usually it’s drone footage
You’re on
You’re on Chan 
You’re out?
You’re pretty good at this stuff. You should start a website or something
You’re pretty iconic lol
You’re probably right but I don’t record my scores and have a wide range of outcomes.
You’re right but welker had too much good play to be the most hated. Same with Aaron Hernandez actually lol
You’re right but you can’t date in your chain of command, which is what that meme is implying 
You’re right it’s NH not VT
You’re right Marcus probably not a top 100 attack
You’re right, we will never know what conversations led up to that deal being agreed to. But in this situation the contract is a big deal that effectively DQs half the teams from playing in the market, and the move needed to be made because of the Zeke contract, so it’s not a player-for-picks move in a vacuum. 
You’re right. Broncos and chiefs have zero chance. 
You’re right. Should be like 4 game for dray 
"You’re saying:
Smith starts, you win
Haskins starts, it’s a null bet because Allen got injured

That’s ridiculous since we agreed on injury nullified "
You’re seeing the giants in a rare time of extreme flux and uncertainty. Hopefully they make it out stronger and form a new dynasty
You’re setting yourself up here
You’re still a cider boi in my mind
You’re still a total weirdo creep, but it’s my fault for thinking you might not be
You’re still crazy
You’re telling me the chunk of fat on the outside of a steak is the best part?? 
You’re thinking about leagues that matter 
You’re way too not-unreasonably confident to trade options on Robin Hood 
You’re welcome / fuck you
You’re welcome Joseph
"You’re Welcome
I Just Can’t Wait To Be King
You’ve Got a Friend in Me"
You’re welcome. You’re also welcome for being more right than the CDC on the J&J vaccine (hence the Dr. part of the Dr. Lt )
You’re willing to accept boosters giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to top recruits as an acceptable risk?
You’re wrong
You’ve gone full cream pie without asking?
You’ve had 6 messages. 0 are positive 
You’ve heard of 2Chainz, now let me introduce you to 2Tiez
You’ve yet to show any data and goody has shown like 4 pieces of data
You'd also have to be a Giants fan
You'd be his first knock out
You'd be Nassau right? Now you'll get to see if your vote would've mattered
You'd really rather 24 donuts than 24 beers?
Youjizz man. I found out a bit ago if you just type in "p2" or "p1" then it shows a bunch of full length videos that are split into 7 minute parts, and you're golden
You'll be right down the street from SiR
Young girl appreciator label shifting from me to Kevin…
Young Jeezy had some bangers
Younghoe, GOAT onside kicker
Your “government name” as they call it
Your absentee ballot must be postmarked 3/25 and received by 3/30. You're good
Your attack would mean more if you didn’t just put up team record
Your betaness couldn’t go lower so I’m scapegoating Jeff 100% on this one
Your body is a battery. Don’t exercise or you’ll burn it up faster
Your capacity to kick the man when he’s down is something I’ll never have
Your crazy
Your dad is ACTUALLY a TITS DOCTOR?!?!?!?
Your ED is a great metaphor for how soft this group has gotten
Your fantasy team = loser shit
Your googling skills need work bruh
Your honor I plead guilty as charged
Your honor, if I was trying to kill someone id shoot em 
Your insult was not inaccurate 
Your insults mean nothing you don’t have a team
Your IRA should give you an option on what funds you want to invest in. The 2055 or whatever is one of those. The SP500 is another
Your link is just the FT homepage?
Your literal last post was dumping on Catholics
Your middle name is Michael
Your place has best viewing experience. I’ll try come over at 2 or so, I have some stuff to do for a bit
Your point about Bloomberg is very true tho
Your professor is literally Mr. Scrooge
Your requirements are absurd
Your second part is right tho
Your side
Your spread + over under don’t add up
Your team is perfect. You don't need picks lol
Your value to the school is hundreds of millions of dollars. The school eats the $200-250K that they'd earn by accepting a normal tuition paying student instead 
Your vote doesn’t matter 
YoUr VoTe DoEsNt MaTtEr
Your welcome present
Your white person card has been revoked
Your whole life is about to be enhanced 
Your*
You're a fantasy legend, keepers shouldn't matter for a manager of your prowess
You're all doing it wrong. You have to find a really vivid happy memory or you're never going to be able to cast a patronus
You're all fags
You're also gonna need to turn your resume into ppt format. It's how they do all their resource proposals 
You're also incredibly lucky in the other league
You're asking the government to define morality?
You're boring
You're both wrong
You're def a Yankees fan because you're too fair weather to be a mets fan
You're just mad because my dad beat you in a shotgun race
You're making it less fun
You're missing 27 and 28
You're missing the squirtle with the sunglasses
You're not a good Chinese
You're not a real baseball fan
You're not asking for any money
You're not gonna change bigoted people's minds by passing a law. In fact it would likely have the opposite effect 
You're not gonna have these guys doing heart surgeries, but you are gonna have them treating bullet wounds
"You're on a game show. There are 3 closed doors. Behind one of them is a car, behind the other 2 are goats. You pick a door but it's not opened yet. The host then opens a different door and it's a goat. He then asks if you want to switch doors. 

Do you switch? And why?"
You're right
You're right close. Idk how you chose those numbers, but there's a mathematical expression that will give you the proper number of floors depending on the total number of floors on the building
You're right, it's 5 permutations 
You're right. The Kelleher Plan is the only solution
You're saying a catch adds nothing to the yards gained from a reception. I get it. But the frequency at which these yards are gained does matter, because football is played with downs (just a reminder for those of you who can't identify a defensive guard). PPR factors in the frequency of yards being gained, and thus does provide a good measure of value added by a catch
You're saying highlight similarities, not differences. I'm saying it's impossible to do one without the other. If you group anything by any factor, the ones without that factor will inherently be highlighted as different
You're saying political BS. I want to get anything and everything I can from a POW immediately, every time.
You're slightly misinterpreting the data. A player that gets 1 steal is equivalent in worth to a player that gets 9 points (all else being equal). The main reason is because of the above discussion on replaceability 
You're still a huge clown and I hope you realize that you're being stupid and don't quit fantasy but if you do then I hope you feel regret every minute of next year's NFL regular season
You're super close, but not quite haha
You're the girl on My Sweet Sixteen who gets a Mercedes and cries because it's not a BMW
You're the one with the constraints so you pick
You're the social media whiz, you figure it out!
You're the worst
You're the worst 
You're the worst baseball fan ever
You're unbelievable hahaha
You're using a map you cheater 
You're wrong
Youth basketball is: pass to tall kid, tall kid misses, tall kid rebounds, tall kid misses, tall kid rebounds, tall kid scores. Rinse. Repeat. 
You've absentmindedly used your debit card as a credit card for sure
You've become an inspiration for kids across Syria

Zach Wilson looks like a Pokémon trainer 
Zack “Randy” Moss
ZACK ZENNER
Zappe inspiring the defense. What a leader
Zappe was the most electric out of the blue player since Lin
"Zeke $52
Diggs $15
Gordon $10
Hogan $12
Adams $17
Henry for $17 if Demarco is moved"
Zeke blocking a DT looked a lot like Mac Jones blocking Chandler Jones

Zero data to back me up here, just a bunch
Zero fun sir 
Zero hearts. Philistines. 
Zero hits. Some gospel sounding bullshit
Zero infrastructure, zero staff, zero artists showed. they're sitting around in FEMA tents eating bread and cheese
Zero recollection of this
